# Exploiting Term Structure of VIX Futures

## Overview

Trades the VIX futures term structure by going short VIX futures in contango and long in backwardation, hedged with S&P 500 E-mini futures. Calculates a daily roll metric (futures − spot / days to settlement) and enters when it exceeds thresholds. Regression-based hedge ratio minimizes directional equity exposure.

## Academic Reference

## Strategy Logic

### Universe Selection

- VIX Futures (continuous contract, open interest mapping)
- S&P 500 E-mini Futures (hedge instrument)
- VIX Spot Index (reference)

### Signal Generation

**Daily roll metric**: (Futures Price − Spot VIX Price) / Days to Settlement.

- **Contango**: Futures > Spot → positive roll.
- **Backwardation**: Futures < Spot → negative roll.

### Entry / Exit Rules

- **Short VIX futures**: Daily roll > 0.10 (contango).
- **Long VIX futures**: Daily roll < −0.10 (backwardation).
- **Exit short**: Daily roll drops below 0.05.
- **Exit long**: Daily roll exceeds −0.05.
- **Force liquidation**: 2 days before contract expiration.

### Portfolio Construction

Hedged with S&P 500 E-mini futures. Hedge ratio from regression: ΔP_VX = β₀ + β₁(ES returns) + β₂(ES returns × days to settlement). Position sizing based on hedge ratio estimates.

### Rebalancing Schedule

Daily rolling window (252-day history). Automatic contract roll via open interest mapping.

## Key Indicators / Metrics

- VIX spot price
- VIX futures price
- Daily roll metric
- Entry/exit thresholds: ±0.10 / ±0.05
- Hedge ratio (regression-based)
- Days to settlement

## Backtest Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Period | 2012 – 2017 |
| Initial Capital | $10,000,000 |
| Updated | Extended to 2024 |

## Data Requirements

- **Asset Classes**: VIX futures, S&P 500 E-mini futures, VIX spot
- **Resolution**: Daily (extended market hours)
- **Lookback**: 252 days for hedge ratio regression
- **Contract Data**: Expiration dates, multipliers

## Implementation Notes

- RollingWindow data structures for historical price tracking.
- Backwards-ratio normalization for continuous contracts.
- OLS regression for hedge ratio estimation.
- Later version monitors spread thresholds (< $0.10) and executes during final 15 minutes.
- Open interest-based contract mapping.
- Python on QuantConnect LEAN.

## Risk Considerations

- "Potentially substantial risks associated with adverse moves in the VIX Futures curve."
- Volatility term structure can shift rapidly during market stress.
- VIX futures have limited liquidity compared to equity futures.
- Basis risk between spot and futures convergence.
- Large capital requirement ($10M) for meaningful positioning.
- Hedge ratio estimation is backward-looking — may lag during regime changes.
- Contract rollover costs and slippage.
