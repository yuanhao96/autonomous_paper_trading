CHAPTER 2 Let’s Get Started Technical analysis is a rule-based trading approach. There are many ways to analyze market information, and the potential variables are endless. A trend is the general direction in which prices are headed. In using technical analysis, the objective is to identify the probable trend as early as possible. Unfortunately, early detection of an impending change in trend is not that easy. There is no single method or system that does so accurately and consistently. Thus, it would be better to use a scorecard approach based on the collective methodology described in this book. In a bull market, most stocks go up and in a bear market most stocks go down. From trial and error in our trading experience and in our research, we have noted that when a trend is underway, four trend-related dimensions give us clues. These clues may not happen at the same time, but usually occur within a span of a few bars. The four dimensions are: 1. Patterns 2. Volume 3. Price Momentum 4. Price and Moving Averages This chapter will briefly introduce each of the four dimensions that need to be studied. The purpose of the study is to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each dimension. The trader will then be able to see from the reactions in each dimension where a change in trend takes place and how to use that information effectively in his trading. And when the trader has learned to string together all aspects of the four dimensions and to apply their coherent signals in trading, he will be trading more confidently. Gradually, he will realize that he is trading more prudently and that the number of his trades has been reduced based on this trading method. He will discover one of the golden tenet of master traders—“More trades do not equate to more profits.” PATTERNS Patterns are a very important aspect of technical analysis. They are the shapes or structures of formations that appear on a chart, including double tops, double bottoms, morning star, head and shoulders, triangles, rectangles, saucers, and so on. Patterns are the body language of price expressions and offer traders a means of forecasting probable price direction. There are two major types of patterns—reversal patterns and continuation patterns. Reversal is a formation pattern that indicates a likely reversal in trend is taking place, that is, from a bullish trend to a bearish trend, or vice versa. The continuation pattern indicates a temporary price retracement and on the breakout of the pattern, the prevailing trend will continue. Patterns are not infallible. There is no chart pattern that will tell you with 100 percent certainty where the price is heading. But learning the characteristics of each pattern formation and using them with other supporting indicators will give traders an edge in reading the market and timing trades. The various patterns are described in
