Read This First What You Absolutely Must Know Read this first … or at least skim it. There are things you must know here. First, congratulations! You've just found something few forex (foreign exchange or currency) beginners ever find—an ideal starting point. CURRENCY RISK: EVERY INVESTOR'S DILEMMA You can't live with them, and you can't live without them. They're often complex, exasperating, unreasonable, and irrational, and they always want more of your time and money. I am referring to trades or investments that give you currency diversification, of course. We all need it, but few succeed in currency markets. The methods commonly used are too risky, complex, and timeconsuming for most people. Unfortunately, it's very hard to find the right guidance for getting started. Virtually all of the socalled “Beginners' Guides” are either: too superficial to give you the practical skills needed to start making money, or too complex and detailed to provide clear step-by-step ways to actually start making money too focused on the usual methods of forex trading that are too risky, complex, and time consuming for most people to use successfully. We've dedicated years to creating a book that avoids these pitfalls. It gives you a variety of approaches to get started via safer, simpler, more profitable ways to lower your risk and increase your returns, either as a conservative forex trader or as a more passive longer-term investor seeking exposure to assets in the best currencies. Unlike other beginners guides, this book has the right balance of practical information and methods you use to actually make money, without burdening you with too much information or the wrong kinds of information. It provides the shortest path to actually making money as soon as your circumstances allow; or in the worst case, to avoid the mistakes and losses that drain your cash and confidence before you have had enough time to find your path to success. Currency Risk and How to Fight It Currency risk is today's great hidden portfolio risk. The governments behind the most widely held currencies are trying to inflate away their debts via low interest rates and “stimulus” (technically not money printing!) programs. It's unclear whether these policies serve the “greater good;” however, they are likely to devalue their currencies, and any portfolios denominated in them. So, for your own financial self-defense against that risk, you obviously need to diversify into assets exposed to sounder currencies, or those currencies themselves.But it's very tough to find solutions suitable for most traders or investors. For aspiring forex (foreign exchange) traders, most of the material available is about complex, demanding, time-consuming, high-leverage, high-risk methods unsuitable for the average riskaverse trader seeking steady profits rather than gambling thrills. Yet the materials aimed at beginners tend to be far too superficial to prepare anyone to actually make money. This book seeks to bridge that yawning gap with safer, smarter, and less demanding ways to trade forex, with the details and examples needed to get you ready to start trading or investing
