Chapter 1 Currency Trading 101 In This Chapter Looking at currency trading as a business Getting a sense of what moves currencies Developing trading strategies to exploit opportunities Implementing the trading plan The foreign exchange, or forex, market has exploded onto the scene and is the hot new financial market. It’s been around for years, but advances in electronic trading have now made it available to individual traders on a scale unimaginable just a few years ago. But just because currency trading is more accessible doesn’t mean it’s widely understood. I’ve spent my professional career in the forex market and I can’t think of a better traders’ market. In my opinion, nothing quite compares to the speed and exhilaration of the forex market or the intellectual and psychological challenges of trading in it. I’ve always looked at my work as essentially doing the same thing every day, but no two days are ever the same. Not many people can say that about their day jobs, and I wouldn’t trade it for the world, no pun intended. Defining Currency Trading At its heart, currency trading is speculation about the value of one currency versus another. The key words in that last sentence are speculation and currency. I think that looking at currency trading from those two angles is essential. On the one hand, currency trading is speculation, pure and simple, just like buying an individual stock or any other financial security in the hope that it will make a profitable return. On the other hand, the securities on which you’re speculating are the currencies of various countries. Viewed separately, that means currency trading is both about the dynamics of market speculation, or trading, and the factors that affect the value of currencies. Put them together and you’ve got the largest, most dynamic and exciting financial market in the world. Throughout this book, I approach currency trading from those two perspectives, looking at them separately and blending them together to give you the information you need to trade in the forex market. Speculating as an enterprise Let me first tell you what speculating isn’t; speculating is not gambling, and it’s not investing. Gambling is about playing with money, even when you know the odds are stacked against you. Investing is about minimizing risk and maximizing return, usually over a long time period (months or years). Speculating, or active trading (I use the terms interchangeably from here out), is about taking calculated financial risks to seek a profitable return, usually over a very short time horizon (minutes, hours, or days). You may be more familiar with speculating or active trading as day trading, but in the 24-hour-a-day forex market it can very easily turn into overnight trading, too. Speculating as an enterprise refers to treating your trading as a serious business venture. In my experience, many newcomers to the forex market enter it too lightly and don’t appreciate the patience and diligence required to be successful. I hope you’ll take to heart the following attributes I think define a successful trader in any market: Dedication (time and energy) Resources (technological and financial) Discipline (emotional and financial) Decisiveness (intellectual and psychological) Perseverance (risk management and opportunism) Knowledge (economic, political, and market dynamics) But even if you possess all those traits, there’s no substitute for developing a comprehensive trading plan (see Chapters 11, 12, and 13, as well as “Developing a Trading Plan” later in this chapter). You wouldn’t open a business venture without first developing a business plan (at least I hope not!). So you shouldn’t expect any success in trading if you don’t develop a realistic trading plan and stick to it. Think of trading as if it were your own business, and approach it as you would a business enterprise, because that’s what it is. Above all, try not to take your trading results too personally. Financial markets are prone to seemingly irrational movements on a regular basis, and the market doesn’t know or care who you are or what your trade idea is. Currencies as the trading vehicle If you’ve heard anything at all about the forex market, it’s probably that it’s the largest financial market in the world, at least in terms of daily trading volumes. To be sure, the forex market is unique in many respects. The volumes are, indeed, huge, which means that liquidity is ever present. It also operates around the clock, from the opening of Asia/Pacific financial centers on Monday morning to the close of North American markets on Friday afternoon, giving traders access to the market any time they need it.
