Chapter 39), we’ll return to this theme, and you’ll see why it is so important to analyze markets in more than one timeframe. We’ll have to make sure that buy or sell messages in both timeframes confirm each other, because if they don’t it means that the market is too chaotic and we should stand aside. Nature’s Law is the rallying cry of a clutch of mystics who claim there is a perfect order in the markets (which they’ll reveal to you for a price). They say that markets move like clockwork in response to immutable natural laws. R. N. Elliott even titled his last book Nature’s Law. The “perfect order” crowd gravitates to astrology, numerology, conspiracy theory, and other superstitions. Next time someone talks to you about natural order in the markets, ask him about astrology. He’ll probably jump at the chance to come out of the closet and talk about the stars. The believers in perfect order in the markets claim that tops and bottoms can be predicted far into the future. Amateurs love forecasts, and mysticism is a great marketing gimmick. It helps sell courses, trading systems, and newsletters. Mystics, Random Walk academics, and Efficient Market theorists have one trait in common. They are equally divorced from the reality of the markets. ■■18. Support and Resistance A ball hits the floor and bounces. Toss it up, and it’ll drop after hitting the ceiling. Support and resistance are like a floor and a ceiling, with prices sandwiched between them. Understanding support and resistance is essential for understanding price trends. Rating their strength helps you decide whether the trend is likely to punch through or to reverse. Support is a price level where buying is strong enough to interrupt or reverse a downtrend. When a downtrend hits support, it bounces like a diver who hits the bottom and pushes away from it. Support is represented on a chart by a horizontal line connecting two or more bottoms (Figure 18.1). Resistance is a price level where selling is strong enough to interrupt or reverse an uptrend. When an uptrend hits resistance, it acts like a man who hits his head on a branch while climbing a tree—he stops and may even tumble down. Resistance is represented on a chart by a horizontal line connecting two or more tops. It is better to draw support and resistance lines across the edges of congestion areas where the bulk of the bars stopped rather than across extreme prices. Those congestion zones show where masses of traders have changed their minds, while the extreme points reflect only panic among the weakest traders. Minor support or resistance causes trends to pause, while major support or resistance causes them to reverse. Traders buy at support and sell at resistance, making their effectiveness a self-fulfilling prophecy. 56 CLASSICAL CHART ANALYSIS FIGURE 18.1â•… NFLX weekly. (Chart by Stockcharts.com) Support and Resistance Draw horizontal lines across the upper and lower edges of congestion areas. The bottom line marks the level of support at which buyers overcome sellers. The upper line identifies resistance, where sellers overpower buyers. Support and resistance areas often switch roles. Note how after a decisive upside breakout in area 1 prices hit resistance, but when they broke above that level it turned into a zone of support (marked 2). The strength of these barriers increases each time prices touch them and bounce away. Beware of false breakouts from support and resistance. They are marked by letter “F” on this chart. Amateurs tend to follow breakouts, while professionals tend to fade (trade against) them. At the right edge of the chart NFLX is rallying from support at the level where its previous rally ran into resistance. How do we identify trends? Not by trendlines. My favorite tools are exponential moving averages that we’ll review in the next section. Trendlines are wildly subjective—they are among the most self-deceptive tools. Trend identification is an area in which computerized analysis is miles ahead of classical charting. Memories, Pain, and Regret Our memories of previous market turns prompt us to buy and sell at certain levels. Buying and selling by crowds create support and resistance. Support and resistance exist because people have memories. If traders remember that prices have recently stopped falling and turned up from a certain level, they are likely to buy when prices approach that level again. If traders remember that an uptrend has recently reversed after rising to a certain peak, they tend to sell and go short when prices approach that level again. For example, all major rallies in the stock market from 1966 until 1982 ended whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied into the area between 950 and 1050. That resistance zone was so strong that traders named it “a graveyard in the sky.” Once the bulls rammed the market through that level, it became a major support area. In recent years, we saw a similar occurrence in gold, whose chart is shown here (Figure 18.2). It hit the level of $1,000/oz four times, dropping after each Get More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com 18. SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE 57 FIGURE 18.2â•… Gold weekly. (Chart by Stockcharts.com) Resistance Turns into Support Notice how gold hit its overhead resistance at the $1,000/oz. level five times. Usually, reversals occur on the first, second or third hit. When a market hits the same level for the fourth time, it shows that it really wants to go that way. Gold broke above $1,000/oz. on its fifth attempt. Afterwards, gold made two attempts to pull down to its old resistance level, in areas marked 6 and 7. Its inability to decline to that level showed that bears were weak, marking the start of a major bull market in gold. attempt. After the price of gold broke above that level on its fifth attempt, the level of $1,000/oz turned into a massive support level. Support and resistance exist because masses of traders feel pain and regret. Traders who hold losing positions fe
