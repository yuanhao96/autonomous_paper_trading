CHAPTER 1 12. SO YOU WANT TO TRADE FOREX? 13 learned the hard way, usually by making a mistake. Mistakes can be resolved and corrected as long as you believe there is a solution. So when you make a mistake that creates a problem, you need to muster the courage to face the problem head-on until a solution is achieved. As you do this repeatedly, unemotionally, you will develop the skill of effective problem solving. Remember, failure is not the problem; the problem lies in the time we waste lamenting over the problem rather than focusing in on the solution to the problem. Failure is not falling down; failure is staying down. Learning from your mistakes is critical to your success. Choosing not to learn from your mistakes as you learn to trade will cause you to become a repeat offender. Your subconscious mind will take over and will form an unproductive bad habit, costing you money. You must pay attention to your mistakes and embrace them with a positive attitude. Do you focus on what you have or on what you have lost? As you go through life making mistakes, you will inevitably lose things along the way—money, close relationships, personal property, you name it. But how much time do you spend holding onto those mistakes? How much time do you spend calculating your losses and wishing you had back everything you had lost? The longer you dwell on past failures and losses, the longer you will stay captive in your current state of failure. You must let go of your past failures and focus on where you are going. Have you ever wondered why the rearview mirror is 50 times smaller than the windshield? The windshield is so much larger to help us stay focused on where we are going versus where we have been. Holding onto past wounds or losses will only stand in the way of achieving your rightful success as a trader. Every trader loses money and makes money as they trade, but successful traders will make more money than they lose. Successful traders spend no time worrying or thinking about their losses; they stay focused on the next opportunity that is knocking. People that manage their poverty or mediocrity are so busy holding onto their past that they can’t grab onto future opportunities. Holding onto past losses or failures creates a bitter mindset. If you come to the trading table with a bitter mindset or victim mentality, you will bring with you all your past emotional baggage that has stood in the way of you becoming successful at anything you attempted in the past. It will stand in the way of you becoming a THE 10 ESSENTIALS OF FOREX TRADING 14 13. successful trader. If you want to be successful at trading, you must focus on what you have gained versus what you have lost. Are you a goal setter or a goal quitter? When you set out to do something, do you persist until you succeed or do you get discouraged and quit along the way? One of the most important habits to develop is the habit of finishing what you started. My son recently graduated from high school. At his graduation ceremony, the principal stood up and congratulated everyone for completing 12 years of education. He also pointed out that during the last year of school, 48 percent of the students in the graduating class had dropped out. They came so close, but they did not persist until the very end. Most people in life are rainbow chasers; they set new goals almost daily. Most of the time their new goals have nothing to do with yesterday’s, last week’s, or even last month’s goals. As a result, they never move forward in any one direction. You need to believe there is a reward at the end of every journey you embark on, a “pot of gold” at the end of each rainbow, or you will give up and never achieve your goal. Setting goals helps you create a road map in life, outlining where you are going. Without that road map you can easily get off track without even knowing it and not know how to get back on. If you do not create goals as you learn to trade, you will not have any recognizable milestones of achievement. Any great achievement will be accompanied by setbacks, but beginning with a clear goal in mind will keep you on track to reach your goals even after you hit a detour. Traders who set goals and persist until they succeed reach their pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. A trader’s pot of gold is described as executing your trades correctly 100 percent of the time. That does not mean you will make money 100 percent of the time, rather, that you consistently make more money than you lose. Persisting to achieve your realistic goals is nothing more than discipline in action. YOUR LIFE’S PURPOSE Successful people live by what they believe not by how they feel. They are what I call constitution-based versus feeling-based. Successful people have strong convictions. They are very clear about their personal constitution and their purpose in life. Constitution-based people will do whatever it
