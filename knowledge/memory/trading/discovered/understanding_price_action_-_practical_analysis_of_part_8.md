With nothing in front of them but the bars in the chart, there is little in their workspace that bears witness of the digital wave. Are they mere relics from a fading past, soon to be extinct, or could it be that there is merit in this seemingly stubborn defiance of trading evolution? One way to answer this is to point out the actual benefits of every indicator craze that has swept across the trading landscape for the past so many years. Not an easy chore by any means. A simpler solu­ tion, perhaps, is to focus attention on the price action trader instead and see if we can come to appreciate his one and only tool, the naked chart. With the latter idea in mind, Understanding Price Action is written not just to establish the virtues of the price action method, but to serve as a practical guide on the matter. The core premise within is that any dedicated student, before long, should be able to trade confidently and profitably from a clean chart without ever feeling lost or otherwise deprived. For the purpose of illustration, any price chart could basically do, but few are better suited for the job than the 5-minute chart of the eur / usd currency pair. A true creature of habit, this market has long since been the favorite of countless traders around the globe and it's hard to v Understanding Price Action think of a more accessible platform for the technical discussions in the chapters ahead. When taking up the task of writing this guide, the objective was not just to show a pallet of trading concepts on a number of cherry-picked charts, but to give a fair impression also of their practical implementa­ tion on a day-to-day basis. For this purpose, the book has been split into two parts.
