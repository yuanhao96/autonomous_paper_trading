Chapter 7), we attempt to identify rules that would help traders determine what type of market they are currently trading in and what sort of trading opportunities they should be looking for. Is Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better? Technical versus fundamental analysis is a longtime battle, and after many years there is still no winner or loser. Most traders abide by technical analysis because it does not require as many hours of study. Technical analysts can follow many currencies at one time. Fundamental analysis, in contrast, tend to specialize due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market. Technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to develop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with equal ease to any time frame or currency traded. However, it is important to take into consideration both strategies, as fundamentals can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or trend reversals, while technical analysis can explain moves that fundamentals cannot, especially in 35 quiet markets, such as resistance in trends. For example, as you can see in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to September 11, 2001, USD/JPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked poised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as technicians may have expected, USD/JPY broke down following the terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88 on September 10.

There are seven major models for forecasting currencies: the balance of payments (BOP) theory, purchasing power parity (PPP), interest rate parity, the monetary model, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the currency substitution model. Balance of Payments Theory The balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their equilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance. Countries with trade deficits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves due to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation's currency in order to 36 receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation's exports less expensive abroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance. What is the Balance of Payments? The balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and the capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items such as cars and manufactured goods; the surplus or deficit between exports and imports is called the trade balance. The capital account measures flows of money, such as investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the web site of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (www.bea.gov). Trade Flows. The trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time between a nations exports and imports. When a country imports more then it exports the trade balance is negative or is in a deficit. If the country exports more than it imports the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance indicates the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through which the macro-economic policies of a country may affect another country. In general, it is considered to be unfavorable for a country to have a trade deficit, in that it negatively impacts the value of the nations currency. For example, if U.S. trade figures show greater imports than exports, more dollars flow out of the United States and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance, in comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other currencies. Capital Flows. In addition to trade flows, there are also capital flows that occur among countries. They record a nation's incoming and outgoing investment flows such as payments for entire (or for parts of) companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and factories. The capital flows are influenced by many factors, including the financial and economic climate of other countries. Capital flows can be in the form of physical or portfolio investments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital flows tends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For developed countries, due to the strength of the equity and fixed income markets, stocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI. Equity Markets Equity markets have a significant impact on exchange rate movements because they are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets where great amounts of capital inflows and outflows occur, and where foreign investors are major participants. The amount of the foreign investment flows in the equity markets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reflecting the well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur when foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus they convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it higher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing recessions, however, foreign investors tend to flee, thus converting back to their home currency and pushing the domestic currency down. Fixed Income (Bond) Markets The effect the fixed income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the equity markets and is a result of capital movements. The investor's in
