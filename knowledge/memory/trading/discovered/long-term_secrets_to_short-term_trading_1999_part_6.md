Chapter 13. 65 Figure 4.7 Restricting trade days makes a big difference. 66 A Look at Volatility In the S&P 500 Does this concept have application for the S&P 500? Although there can be no doubt about this technique working with a 50 percent volatility expansion, we can improve on it a great deal. How? By using something we already know about, the impact of TDW. The next set of data shows the volatility breakout performance by each day of the week for Figure 4.9 Trading on Tuesdays. 67 Figure 4.10 Trading on Wednesdays. the S&P 500. The exit is the same as with the bonds shown earlier. Clearly, some are days better than others to trade. Figures 4.8 through 4.12 show the buy signals by day of week; Figures 4.13 through 4.17 show sell signals by day of week. Figure 4.18 shows trading on just the more influential days. The best days to be a buyer were all days except Thursday and Friday, while the best sell day was Thursday, with Friday a push, but it is used in the following listing. This is not a bad system, it "made" $227,822 with 75 percent accuracy on Figure 4.11 Trading on Thursdays. 68 69 70 1,333 trades and had a very small drawdown of only $13,737. I would prefer a larger average profit per trade than the $170 shown here. An astute, thinking trader should be asking questions like, "Could we use a closer volatility expansion number to be a buyer on the more bullish days and a farther away entry value on the days that don't work so well with the 50 percent value? And how about our exit, would it pay off to hold longer on the more bullish/bearish days?" 71 These questions can continue indefinitely, but do need to be asked to optimize performance. Proof that research pays off is offered by Figure 4.19, which shows the use of the preceding rules, except that the buy entry comes at 40 percent of the previous day's range added to the open, the sell entry at 200 percent of the range subtracted from the open. There is a big difference here; while it actually makes a little less money ($14,000), the accuracy goes to 83 percent, the average profit per trade is escalated to $251, and our number of trades is reduced by 46 percent! Separating Buyers from Sellers to Find Volatility Using Market Swings A third way to measure potential volatility expansions comes from looking at price swings over the past several days. Mike Chalek deserves credit for this concept with a system he designed and labeled, "Talon." The basic idea is to look at the various swings price has taken from one point to the next over the past few years. There are many such points to study. The ones I have chosen for this next glimpse into market activity, measure the amount of price movement from the high 3 days ago to today's low. That is Step 1. Step 2 is to take the swing distance from the high 1 day ago minus the low 3 days ago. Finally, we will use the largest of these values as our basic volatility measurement to begin the process of designing a filter or price cushion to add to tomorrow's opening for buying or subtract for selling. The system does okay; it makes money as the following results on the S&P 500 from 1982 to 1998 demonstrate (see Figure 4.20). 72 The rules are to buy at 80 percent of the swing value above the opening and sell at 120 percent of the swing value below the opening. Use a dollar stop of $1,750 and my bailout exit. This makes $122,837 from 1982 to 1998 with an average profit per trade of $228. Results As always though, the question becomes, can we do better? Our last attempt at doing better was to use TDW as our filter to substantially improve performance. We will now go beyond this and bring in a fundamental consideration-the impact of bond prices on stock prices. We will now try this concept as a filter (Figure 4.21). The rule is quite simple, we will only take buy signals if the closing price of bonds is greater today than 5 days ago, and only take sells if bonds are lower than 3 5 days ago. Our reasoning is well founded in the somewhat common knowledge that higher bond prices are bullish for stocks, lower bond prices bearish. What a difference this makes! An average profit per trade goes from $228 to $281 while our drawdown plummets from $13,025 to only $5,250. Best of all though is that in the original "nonfiltered" trades we had a largest losing trade of $8,150, whereas with the bond filter the largest loss was only $2,075! 73 One Step Further Your education is nearing completion if you are wondering what happens in this model if we only take signals on the best TDWs while the trend of the Bond market is giving us bullish or bearish confirmation? Again, the results speak for themselves: by combining all these ingredients we increase our chances or odds for short-term trading success. 'Notice the number of trades is substantially reduced, this means our exposure is less, but our average profit per trade increases. Our profits decline to "only" $76,400 but the average profit per trade jumps to $444, drawdown stays about the same at $5,912 but the percent of winning trades goes to 90 percent. What we have done here is filter out trades that are not backed by all three of our conditions. Filtered trading for short-term swings will put you a light year-or two-ahead of all the rest of the short-term traders. There is an extra advantage here; by using filters you are placing demands on the market, demands that mean you will not trade every day, demands that naturally force you to trade less, not more. Active traders are usually losing traders. Those of us who pick and choose our spots to speculate are more inclined to come out winners as we have tipped the scales in our favor, which is what intelligent speculation is all about.
