Chapter 9. Planetary positions, which are available through astronomical almanacs on computer programs, may be plotted either as a horoscope chart or against a price chart. However, the interpretation of planetary movements and the events they imply is best explained by examples. For traders who are new to the subject, it may be easier to start using a chart analysis program like TradeStation with an astro add-on module. The following charts are examples of plots of the lunar cycles, the eclipse cycles, the planets’ positions, the planetary aspects, and planetary pairs, produced with add-on modules from www.soulytion.de . Figure 2.7 shows the plots of the lunar cycles together with an indicator of solar and lunar eclipses in the lower window. The blue histogram bars represent lunar eclipses and the green histogram bars show the solar eclipses. As described further on, eclipses may increase the effect of either the new moon or the full moon. FIGURE 2.7 Chart showing how the full moon and new moon, called lunations, often coincide with highs and lows in the market. While the new moon (marked by blue lines) is a time to buy and the full moon (marked by red lines) is a time to sell, the phase may not always hold true in the short term.
