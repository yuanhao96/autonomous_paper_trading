CHAPTER 1 The Argument for a Sentiment-Based Approach t its core, sentiment is a general thought, feeling, or sense. In free markets, sentiment refers to the feelings and emotions of market participants. All of the participants’ feelings toward a specific market result in a dominant psychology that is either optimistic or pessimistic. Every change in price results from a change in the balance between optimism and pessimism. Price itself is a result of where collective psychology lies in the never-ending oscillation between optimism and pessimism. As oscillation suggests, the psychological state of a market experiences peaks (optimistic extreme) and troughs (pessimistic extreme). These sentiment extremes are what affect market tops and bottoms. In the 1932 edition of Charles Mackay’s classic Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, Bernard Baruch wrote in the foreword that “all economic movements, by their very nature, are motivated by crowd psychology.” Baruch went on to write in the same foreword that “without due recognition of crowd-thinking (which often seems crowd-madness) our theories of economics leave much to be desired.”1 It seems that so many, if not most, of the members of the financial community seem to forget these basic truths. Analysts, traders, and financial media members attribute reasons to price movements with an uncanny ease. For example, “The government reported a larger than expected increase in the number of jobs created, which supported the U.S. dollar.” Forget that the same report one month earlier indicated that fewer jobs were created than expected . . . and the dollar rallied anyway. On that day, the A 1 P1: PIC/b c01 P2: c/d QC: e/f JWBK195-Saettele 2 T1: g May 31, 2008 11:15 Printer: Yet to come SENTIMENT IN THE FOREX MARKET headline probably read something like this: Dollar Rallies Despite Downbeat Jobs Report. These examples are hypothetical, but if you follow the currency market, you have undoubtedly witnessed similar inconsistencies in financial reporting. How can the movement of a currency be attributed to an outside event such as the release of an economic indicator one month when the same currency and same economic indicator show absolutely no relationship in other months? If a relationship exists only some of the time, then by definition there is no consistent relationship. Yet, the majority of market participants base trading decisions on economic indicators anyway. Why? Even though the approach is suspect, it is conventional and popular and humans like to be with the crowd, even if they are wrong. It is much easier to be wrong in a crowd than be wrong by yourself. Baruch also wrote in the foreword of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds that: Entomologists may be able to answer the question about the midges and to say what force creates such unitary movement by thousands of individuals, but I have never seen the answer. The migration of some types of birds; the incredible mass performance of the whole species of ocean eels; the prehistoric tribal human eruptions from Central Asia; the Crusades; the mediaeval dance crazes; or, getting closer to economics, the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles; the Tulip Craze; and (are we too close to add?) the Florida boom and the 1929 market-madness in America and its sequences in 1930 and 1931—all these are phenomena of mass action under impulsions and controls which no science has explored. They have power unexpectedly to affect any static condition or so-called normal trend. For that reason, they have place in the considerations of thoughtful students of world economic conditions.2 The last example that Baruch cited, the 1929 stock market crash, may be on the verge of repeating as I write this book in late 2007. The herding instinct is a fact of human nature and manifests itself in all our speculative activities; whether real estate, stock markets, or currency valuations. Markets move in trends but reverse at extreme levels of bullishness (tops) and bearishness (bottoms) as English economist Arthur C. Pigou explained: “An error of optimism tends to create a certain measure of psychological interdependence until it leads to a crisis. Then the error of optimism dies and gives birth to an error of pessimism.”3 This is the rule in all financial markets, where man’s impulse to herd creates extreme and unsustainable levels that ultimately lead to a reversal. Markets always overshoot and do not seek equilibrium as the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) would have you believe.

Under this approach, a trader will buy a country’s currency if the news of that country is considered good. If the news of a country’s currency is considered bad, then the trader sells that country’s currency. This model assumes that EMH governs markets because it assumes that market participants will make objective trading decisions based on rational thought (buy if the news is good and sell if the news is bad). However, market participants do not make objective trading decisions based on rational thought; they make subjective trading decisions based on emotions. If you have ever traded FX, then you know this because you have witnessed a currency rally that followed a worse than expected jobs report or an increase in that country’s trade deficit. Still, the news was explained in order to rationalize the market movement. If explaining the news in order to rationalize the market movement proves too difficult, then the market move is often attributed to a “technical” correction or something similar. This is not to say that news and economic releases are unimportant. It is imperative that you know when the releases occur because volatility spikes
