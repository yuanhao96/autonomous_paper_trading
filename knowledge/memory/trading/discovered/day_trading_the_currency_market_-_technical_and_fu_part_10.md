For USD/JPY, though, the longer-term risk reversals indicate that the market is strongly favoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts. How Can You Use This Information? For easier graphing and tracking purposes, we use positive and negative integers for call and put premiums, respectively, in Figure 9.18. Therefore a positive number indicates that calls are preferred over puts and that the market as a whole is expecting an upward movement in the underlying currency.
