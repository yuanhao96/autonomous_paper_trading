Chapter 1 • Trend Following “One evening, while having dinner with a fundamentalist, I accidentally knocked a sharp knife off the edge of the table. He watched the knife twirl through the air, as it came to rest with the pointed end sticking into his shoe. ‘Why didn’t you move your foot?’ I exclaimed. ‘I was waiting for it to come back up,’ he replied.”9 Don’t we all know an investor who is waiting for “his” market to come back? The financial website marketer Motley Fool has a backstory, a narrative behind how it started, that reflects the folly of literally banking on fundamental analysis as a solution for making money: “It all started with chocolate pudding. When they were young, brothers David and Tom Gardner learned about stocks and the business world from their father at the supermarket. Dad, a lawyer and economist, would tell them, ‘See that pudding? We own the company that makes it! Every time someone buys that pudding, it’s good for our company. So go get some more!’ The lesson stuck.”10 The Motley Fools’ David and Tom Gardner’s pudding story might be cute, but it is Forrest Gump-like simplistic (and wrong). Their plan gets you in, but it doesn’t tell you when to get out or how much of the pudding stock you must buy. Unfortunately, many people believe that simple story is a good strategy for making money. That is a sad state of affairs. A second market theory, technical analysis, operates in stark contrast to fundamental analysis. This approach is based on the belief that at any given point in time market prices reflect all known factors affecting supply and demand for that particular market. Instead of evaluating fundamental factors, technical analysis looks at the market prices themselves. Technical traders believe that a careful analysis of daily price action is an effective means of trading for profit. Now here is where an understanding of technical analysis becomes complicated. There are essentially two forms of technical analysis. One form is based on an ability to “read” charts and use “indicators” to predict market direction. Here is an example of the mentality behind a predictive view of technical analysis: 9 But I think our ace in the hole is that the governments usually screw things up and don’t maintain their sound money and policy coordination. And about the time we’re ready to give up on what usually has worked, and proclaim that the world has now changed, the governments help us out by creating unwise policy that helps produce dislocations and trends. Jerry Parker11 While a fundamental analyst may be able to properly evaluate the economics underlying a stock, I do not believe they can predict how the masses will process this same information. Ultimately, it is the dollar-weighted collective opinion of all market participants that determines whether a stock goes up or down. This consensus is revealed by analyzing price. Mark Abraham Quantitative Capital Management, L.P. 10 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets “I often hear people swear they make money with technical analysis. Do they really? The answer, of course, is that they do. People make money using all sorts of strategies, including some involving tea leaves and sunspots. The real question is: Do they make more money than they would investing in a blind index fund that mimics the performance of the market as a whole? Most academic financial experts believe in some form of the random-walk theory and consider technical analysis almost indistinguishable from a pseudoscience whose predictions are either worthless or, at best, so barely discernibly better than chance as to be unexploitable because of transaction costs.”12 Markets aren’t chaotic, just as the seasons follow a series of predictable trends, so does price action. Stocks are like everything else in the world: They move in trends, and trends tend to persist. Jonathan Hoenig Portfolio Manager, Capitalistpig Hedge Fund LLC This is the view of technical analysis held by most people who know of technical analysis—that it is some form of mysterious chart reading technique, such as astrology. Equity research from a major bank furthers my prediction distinction point: It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the ones most responsive to change. Charles Darwin However, this type of price analysis never allows trend followers to enter at the exact bottom of a trend or exit at the exact top of the trend. Second, with price analysis, they don’t necessarily trade every day. Instead, trend followers wait patiently for the right market conditions instead of forcing the market. Third, there should be no performance goals with price analysis. Some traders might embrace a strategy that dictates, for example, “I must make $400 dollars a day.” Trend followers would counter with, “Sure, but what if the markets don’t move on a given day?” “The question of whether technical analysis works has been a topic of contention for over three decades. Can past prices forecast future performance?”13 However, there is another type of technical analysis that neither tries to predict or forecast. This type is based on reacting to price action. Trend followers are the group of technical traders who use reactive technical analysis. Instead of trying to predict a market direction, their strategy is to react to the market’s movements whenever they occur. This enables them to focus on the market’s actual moves and not get emotionally involved with trying to predict direction or duration.
