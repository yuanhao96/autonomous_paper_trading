Chapter 6 Important Elements of Successful Foreign Exchange Trading 195 The Boring Side of Success 196 A Risky Business 196 Fatter Is Healthier (But Only for Trading Accounts) 197 Risk and Reward 198 Fix Your Fractions 200 Trailing Stops—Loyal Followers 201 Size Matters 202 Position Overload 205 Measuring Risk with a Trendline 208 Great Expectations 209 Psychologically Speaking 210 Plan the Trade and Trade the Plan 214 Chapter Summary 216 Index 219 x ftoc.indd x 1/13/09 10:16:39 AM Preface oreign exchange trading has developed at such a blinding speed within the last decade that is has garnered an unprecedented amount of interest from all corners of the globe. The meteoric rise of forex can be attributed to the many advantages of trading currencies over other financial markets. These advantages will all be discussed within the pages of this book. More important than recognizing how forex trading can work to your benefit, however, is knowing exactly how to approach this fascinating market with the proper prudence, attitude, and methodology to achieve consistent profitability. Only in this way can the advantages of forex trading truly be realized. This book will assist you in learning many of the most important aspects of playing the currency game effectively. I personally began my journey in forex trading when the retail foreign exchange industry was still in its early infancy. Before I ever even looked at a price chart of a currency pair or followed a forex news feed, I placed a live trade on the EUR/USD with real money. When a substantial sum was lost on that first trade, I placed another trade. And then another. And yet another. Admittedly, I kept doing F xi fpref.indd xi 1/13/09 10:15:41 AM Preface this until I lost almost every single penny in my trading account. I had absolutely no rational reason or justification to place any of those first several trades in that initial trading account. To me, at that time, forex was purely a game of instinct and gut feel. Needless to say, those early days taught me a good lesson. Most humans are not instinctively good at trading. For the vast majority of us, guts and instinct left unchecked invariably lead to catastrophic losses at some point in time, usually sooner rather than later. On attaining this realization, I began a tireless quest to become a profitable forex trader. My efforts consisted of a prolonged, single-minded endeavor to absorb forex-specific analytical methodologies, highly touted currency trading strategies, and sound money management techniques. My search for the “holy grail” of foreign exchange trading had begun in earnest. Over time, I realized that this holy grail of forex, in the traditional sense, was not only elusive but most likely nonexistent. I came to the conclusion that although a bunch of chart indicators all flashing the same signal at the same exact time to enter into a currency trade is a very nice thing to see, it probably would not by itself be able to feed a typical family on a consistent basis. The true holy grail, I eventually found, is a combination of good analytical and trading technique, great risk/money management, and phenomenal discipline. Without these vital components, consistent profitability in forex trading would be difficult to achieve. This is where the book you are holding comes in. It is not meant to be an exhaustive tome that covers every detailed aspect of the foreign exchange world. Rather, this book is meant to serve as a practical guide to help you develop some of the most important xii fpref.indd xii 1/13/09 10:15:41 AM Preface tools and attributes necessary for approaching forex trading in an intelligent and well-prepared manner. Essentials of Foreign Exchange Trading is the kind of book that I wish I had read during the earlier years of my forex trading career. But even now, after many years of trading this market and analyzing foreign exchange price movements for countless traders around the globe on behalf of FX Solutions, I occasionally find myself neglecting some of the essential concepts of good forex trading. Therefore, I have included all of these key concepts within the pages of this book— writing them down in this manner has helped me to refocus on what is truly important in one’s quest for profitability in this market. In short, this book is highly relevant for all who strive to increase their probability of achieving success in forex trading. Once you have read through and digested this book, I would be happy to receive any comments and/or questions you may have. Learning to trade foreign exchange is most certainly a pursuit best accomplished by interacting with other forex traders. In that spirit, you can reach me at anytime simply by e-mailing author@ fxtradingbook.com. I welcome your thoughts.
