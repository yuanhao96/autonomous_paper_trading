Chapter 6 we will look at the market mechanisms that are the source of proﬁt for countertrend trading: support and resistance. 24 • Way of the Turtle Swing Trading Swing trading is essentially the same as trend following except that it targets shorter-term market moves. For example, a good swing trade may last three or four days instead of several months. Swing traders often look for patterns in price movement that indicate a higher likelihood of a signiﬁcant short-term price movement in one direction or another. Swing traders tend to use shorter-term charts that show price bars for every ﬁve minutes, ﬁfteen minutes, or every hour. On these charts a large three- or four-day move will appear the way a threeto six-month trend does on a daily bar chart. Day Trading Day trading is not so much a style as it is a reference to the extremely short-term time frames involved. A true day trader looks to exit the market before it closes each day. This makes his or her position less susceptible to large adverse moves spurred by news occurring overnight. Day traders generally use one of three different trading styles: position trading, scalping, or arbitrage. Day traders generally use a style such as trend following or countertrend trading but do it over a much shorter period. A trade may last a few hours instead of days or months. Scalping is a specialized form of trading that was once the domain of only those traders on the ﬂoor of the exchange. Scalpers are looking to make the difference between the bid and the ask, which is known as the spread. If gold is $550 bid and $551 ask, a scalper will be looking to buy at $550 and sell at $551. For this reason scalpers create liquidity by bidding and offering, hoping for a balance of buy and sell orders. Taming the Turtle Mind • 25 Arbitrage is a form of trading that capitalizes on price differences in the same market or in very similar markets. Often these markets are traded on different exchanges. For example, an arbitrage trader may buy gold on the Comex ﬂoor at $550 and sell ﬁve e-mini gold contracts on the CBOT’s globex exchange for $555 to capture a very short-term price mismatch. Watching the Market State Each of these strategies tends to work better some of the time: When the price movement of a market behaves in a particular way or when that market is in a particular state. As Figure 2-1 illustrates, speculative markets exist in one of four states: • Stable and quiet: Prices tend to stay within a relatively small range with little movement up or down outside that range. • Stable and volatile: There are large daily or weekly changes, but without major changes over a period of months. • Trending and quiet: There is slow movement or drift in prices when measured over a period of months but without severe retracement or price movement in the opposite direction. • Trending and volatile: There are large changes in price accompanied by occasional signiﬁcant shorter-term reversals of direction. Trend followers love markets that are trending and quiet. They can make money without having signiﬁcant adverse price movement. 26 • Way of the Turtle The Four Market States Figure 2-1 Stable and Quiet Stable and Volatile Trending and Quiet Trending and Volatile The Four Market States This makes it very easy to keep a trade for a long time because the market does not give back proﬁts during the trade. Volatile markets are much more punishing for trend followers. It can be very difﬁcult to hold onto a trade when proﬁts are vanishing for days or weeks at a time. Countertrend traders love markets that are stable and volatile. These types of markets have relatively large swings but remain in a fairly narrow range of prices. Swing traders like volatile markets, whether trending or not. Volatile markets present more opportunities because swing traders make money on short term price moves. These types of moves are the characteristic that deﬁnes volatile markets. Although it’s sometimes easy to tell when a market is in one of these states, both the degree of trendiness and the volatility vary over time. This means that many times markets simultaneously display Taming the Turtle Mind • 27 characteristics of two states, with one of the attributes shifting from a low value to a high one or vice versa. For instance, you may have a market that starts out trending and quiet, and then as the trend progresses, the volatility increases so that you get price movement that changes from trending and quiet to trending and volatile. A Turtle never tries to predict market direction but instead looks for indications that a market is in a particular state. This is an important concept. Good traders don’t try to predict what the market will do; instead they look at the indications of what the market is doing.

The entire Turtle training, and indeed the basis for all successful trading, can be summed up in these four core principles. he Turtle training sessions were held in a conference room at the Union League Club in Chicago, two blocks east of the CBOT. From the get-go, the experience was rife with contradiction. For instance, we were instructed to wear jackets since the Union League Club had a dress code, but that did not mesh with Rich’s personality. He was not the kind of guy who would require a dress code. Also, I have no idea how we ended up in this particular room, but one could not have chosen a more unlikely place for our training. The Union League Club was the quintessential gentleman’s club. Its early members included such Chicago luminaries as Philip Danforth Armour of the meat company; George Pullman, who created the luxury Pullman railroad car; Marshall Field; and John Deere.
