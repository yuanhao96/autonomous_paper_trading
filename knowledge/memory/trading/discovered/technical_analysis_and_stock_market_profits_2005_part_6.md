authors and their timely book which has sold some 800,000 plus copies and in later years has earned for itself the accolade of “the bible of Technical Analysis.” A check with most dedicated technical analysts who have learned their craft since 1948 would confirm their personal debt to this work, which was responsible for introducing them to Technical Analysis or expanding their technical education. But how did all of this come about? Technical Analysis certainly did not have a long history of acceptance in the 1940s and before by the established investment fraternity in New York, London, Paris and elsewhere. Without a doubt it was easier to keep to long held beliefs that this form of analysis, utilizing charts of share price action, was more akin to mumbo-jumbo than to the accepted seemingly logical approach built around the respectable tools of Fundamental Analysis. To value a company it was enough to analyze its accounts, work out its p/e ratio, be aware of its research developments, weigh up its reported sales figures, estimate future prospects, etc., thus arriving at a basis to value the company in terms of its share price. Comparing that with the technical analyst’s toolbox containing charts, horizontal, vertical, angular and squiggly lines, fanciful looking patterns, pictured formations, plus indicators, oscillators and the like, logical investment thinking easily came to the conclusion that Technical Analysis was a pseudo-scientific approach that basically relied on price, time, and volume numbers, and paid little or no attention to the company itself.

Looking back now, it is easy to see that the post-World War II period investment scene was ripe for new thinking not contrary to, but in addition to, the established fundamental approach that relied heavily on the work that flowed out of the large brokerage firms’ research departments to their customers. Filling that vacuum knowingly or unknowingly, Messrs Edwards and Magee produced their timely and technically definitive book which not only gave organized form and shape to the field of Technical Analysis, but also gave rise to new analytical thought that the postwar age could substantially make use of as an efficient methodology for investment timing and selection. In the years prior to the publication of their influential Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, it should not go unnoticed, however, that many books were published that can certainly be described as outstanding technical works encompassing many phases of this analytical technology and thinking. A good number of these books and courses were as original and as technically advanced as anything on the subject of Technical
