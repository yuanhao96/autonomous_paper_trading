Chapter 6 Chapter | 10 Using Oscillators with the Elliott Wave Principle Adjusting Tradihonal Fibonacci Projechons for Higher Probability Targets 247 A market move that requires several days to develop is used to walk readers through a real-time, stepby-step progression to show how to apply the Elliott Wave Principle. As the market unfolds through a time-sequenced event, all the rules, guidelines, and patterns are discussed to show how they are used to predict future market action. 13 5 Weaknesses exist in the industry's standard use of Fibonacci relationships. The industry in general determines 0.382, 0.500, and 0.618 retracement levels from distinct price highs and lows and also projects 618, equality, and 1.618 market swings from the same pivot levels. This chapter reveals methods for more accurate price projection to accommodate the normal expansion and contraction cycles present in all markets. In addition, it demonstrates why price spikes or key reversals should not be used to determine Fibonacci retracement targets. The prior chapters are also applied to clarify how the different techniques are combined. Wave counts in hindsight versus developing wave scenarios unfolding in real-time to predict future market movement require different skills. The differences are discussed, and common misunderstandings in the industry are identified. vi • Contents The chapter concludes with an in-depth look at an analytic method used to develop long-horizon wave interpretations for the S 6 P 500.
