Part IV-The View from the Floor 166 167 Brian Gelber-Broker Turned Trader Brian Gelber began his career as a broker, managing a major brokerage firm's financial futures operations on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade. After successfully advising institutional clients, he began trading for his own account. In the early days of T-bond futures trading, Gelber enjoyed the dual distinction of being one of the most (if not the most) prominent brokers on the floor and one of the largest local traders. In January 1986, Gelber expanded his trading to include the direct management of customer accounts. In addition to his own trading, Gelber supervises a group of traders in both cash and futures in government securities and othermarkets. He is the president of a group of companies: Gelber Group, Gelber Management, and Gelber Securities. These companies are involved in clearing, brokerage, and money management. Gelber's relaxed personality seemed almost out of place with his profession. Instead of the high level of intensity expected of someone who trades and supervises trading in multimillion dollar bond positions daily, I found a man who talks about his work as if he were describing a pleasant vacation. Although our meeting took place during trading hours, Gelber did not seem to be overly concerned with the bond market. In fact, he seemed quite relaxed, despite leaving the trading desk for his private office to conduct our interview. "I'll probably do better by staying here," he remarked, obviously reflecting what he perceived to be a low-opportunity market at the time. In response to a query regarding other traders I was interviewing, I mentioned that one, Tony Saliba, had made the cover of the current issue of Success magazine. Gelber asked me if I had a copy. I pulled out the magazine from my attache case and handed it to him. He smiled as he read the bold headline describing Saliba's experience during the week of the October 19,1987, stock market crash: "Victory! He Made $4 Million in Seventy-Two Hours." Jokingly, Gelber asked, "I made $4 million in twenty minutes on that day; how come I'm not on a magazine cover?" It was not meant to be boastful. It did, however, very specifically summarize a basic truth about great traders: Many, if not most, maintain relatively low profiles and are therefore virtually unknown to the public. How did you get started in this industry? After graduating from college in 1976,1 backpacked around the country. In Salt Lake City, I answered an ad for a commodity broker position. I didn't have any idea what it was, but I figured it was something like a stockbroker. I got my license while working for a guy who was basically running a boiler room operation. You really started out on the wrong side of the business. When I walked in, there was a guy seated at the back end of a penny stock office. He spent his days on the phone trying to convince people to give him $5,000 or $10,000 to speculate onhis charting system. It was a real fly-by-night operation. I was keeping his charts for him, while getting registered. I kept saying to myself, "This guy is pretty much of a crook." I got my license and quit. Then I bummed around for another few months, just working temporary jobs to pay the rent. What kind of jobs? Unloading railroad cars. Then one day I walked into a Thomson McKin-non office and said, "Hey, I have a broker's license." The fellow there said he would pay me $800 a month. That was a large amount of money for me at the time. All I had to do was go in and cold call; any accounts I opened would be mine. But you knew virtually nothing at all about markets at that time. I had read a couple of books, and I knew something about charts—having kept them for the first fellow I worked for. What books did you read? There weren't too many around at that time. The book I learned the most from was Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by Robert D. Edwards and John Magee (John Magee, Inc., 109 State Street, Boston, MA). 168 What other books would you recommend to people? The first book we have our traders read is Edwin Lefevre's account of Jesse Livermore, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator [Reprinted in 1985 from the original 1923 edition by Trader Press, Inc., Greenville, SC.] I've read it at least a dozen times. Anyway, around the time that I started at Thomson McKinnon, the Ginnie Mae market was just coming into its own. Thomson McKinnon had just hired a trading group to run a Ginnie Mae desk. I told them I was interested in learning more about the Ginnie Mae market. Why were you attracted to that market? It was a new market and seemed more manageable than the conventional commodities. I figured my business would grow more steadily if I focused on that market. Also, I had made a number of trades in Ginnie Maes. The first trade was a winner, but the following ones were all losers. It was magnetic; I felt I could make money there, but I kept losing, and that made me want to learn more about it. It sounds like you had a minor compulsion to pursue it. Yes, because I had failed. Anyway, the traders at the Ginnie Mae desk taught me a few things, and I went out and opened almost every mortgage banker account in Salt Lake. Did you understand the Ginnie Mae market at that time? When I first started opening accounts, I didn't understand anything about it. How then did you sell people on yourself? I snowballed them at first, but I listened and I learned from the questions they asked me. Initially, I was confused by what they were doing, and they were equally confused by what I was trying to sell them. At least you understood futures as an instrument. Right. And with that limited knowledge, I bumbled through my first few meetings. Then I really got pretty good at it. Were these hedging accounts? Yes, all pure hedging accounts. By May 1977,1 was making $2,000 a month in commissions. That was a tremendous amount of money for me. Was this all in the Ginnie Mae market? At that point, yes.
