Chapter 24 on head-and-shoulders bottoms for specific trading hints. Stop loss Stocks sometimes decline to the lowest of the right shoulders then turn around. Look for support areas near the shoulders. Place a stop-loss order 0.15 below the lowest shoulder or head. Watch for throwback Buy or add to the position during a throwback. Wait for prices to finish falling before placing the trade as prices sometimes throw back and continue moving down. 4366_25.qxd 2/23/05 402 12:01 PM Page 402 Head-and-Shoulders Bottoms, Complex The chart in Figure 25.5 shows a complex head-and-shoulders bottom that forms after nearly a 2-year run-up in prices. The formation marks a reversal of the 6-month retrace. It took just 2 weeks after the breakout to reach the target, but the stock was not done climbing. It moved sideways for almost a year before continuing higher. The stock reached a high of 39.38, nearly triple the head low of 13.50 and more than double the breakout price. Trade inner head and shoulders. Since a head-and-shoulders chart pattern is part of the larger CHSB, then trade the inner pattern. Buy when price pierces a down-sloping neckline or use the inner right shoulder high as the breakout price. Usually, this approach will get you in sooner and the signal is just as strong. With dual heads, the pattern is somewhat different. The dual-head formation usually has head lows that are less than a month apart. Two heads that are close together distinguish the formation from a classic double bottom. Shoulder symmetry and a near horizontal neckline should put the finishing touches on formation identification. Stop loss. Once you take a position in the stock, set your stop-loss point. Many times the various shoulder troughs will act as support levels. If your head-and-shoulders formation is near the yearly low, then there is a very good chance that prices will either turn around at the head or decline slightly below it (by 10% or so) before bottoming out. From that point, prices climb higher. Allen Telecom Inc. (Telecom.

The figure shows the target price found using the measure rule. Compute the formation height from the head low to the neckline and add the difference to the breakout price. The right shoulders often offer support during future declines. 4366_25.qxd 2/23/05 12:01 PM Page 403 Sample Trade 403 If your formation is not within the lowest third of the yearly price range, then sell the stock once prices drop below the head. Prices falling below the head signal a formation failure, and it is best to cut your losses instead of praying that they will turn around. They will not. Watch for throwback. After an upward breakout, over 60% of the time, the stock throws back to the neckline. Consider adding to your position or placing a long trade once prices stop declining. You should wait for prices to rebound on a throwback or else you could find yourself in a situation similar to that shown in Figure 25.2. Prices throw back to the neckline and then continue down for over a week. Depending on when you bought the stock, you could have seen a near 10% price improvement if you had waited a few days. Sample Trade When the weather is nice, I like to take my bicycle out for a spin and give the automobile drivers something to aim for. On one of my bike trips I met Melody. After I told her what I did for a living, she confessed that she was a nightclub dancer and made oodles in tips. I was unsure whether I bought her story, but she looked pretty enough (wearing a bike helmet and sun glasses, who can tell?). Anyway, she told me about a trade she had made in the stock pictured in Figure 25.5. The stock intrigued her because a trend line drawn from the highest high in early October to just after the head marked a turning point. That is where prices moved up enough to pierce the trend line. Melody knew that prices usually retest the low before beginning an extended move upward, so she followed the stock and watched it loop around and dip to 14. Then she glanced sideways and noticed the other dip at 14.38. That is when she uncovered the (inner) head-and-shoulders bottom. A neckline connecting the rises between the two shoulders was impossibly steep; there was no way she could apply the traditional measure rule to determine a target price (because price had not closed above the neckline), so she decided to buy into the stock when prices closed above the right shoulder high. This event occurred in late May and she received a fill at 17.50. Taking a closer look at the graph, she saw two more shoulders, one during early February and the mirror image in mid-May, both at 16. Her simple head-and-shoulders bottom changed into the complex variety. The realization did not affect her investment plans at all, but it made the situation more interesting. She wondered if another pair of shoulders would appear. Her suspicions were fulfilled during late July when another shoulder developed. This one at 15.75 mirrored the shoulder in mid-December 1993. Soon, prices began moving up. They climbed above the break-even point in mid-August and staged an upward breakout. Now she was able to apply the measure rule for the complex bottom and found the target was 22.13. 4366_25.qxd 2/23/05 404 12:01 PM Page 404 Head-and-Shoulders Bottoms, Complex Since she did not need the money immediately, she held onto the shares as prices rose. She thought the stock had enough upward momentum to reach the old high at about 29.25, and she set her sights on that. As long as prices did not drop below the purchase price, she would stay in the trade. She saw the stock building a base between 21 and 26 an
