Chapter 1 begins with the release of previously undisclosed evidence about the most preferred chart types and technical studies. It continues into a lucid and simple summary of the essential elements of those chart types and indicators. The following chapters continue with in-depth explanations of the work of Julius de Kempenaer, Phil Erlanger, Cynthia Kase, Andrew Kezeli, and Rick Knox. All of the chapters can be considered work that has mostly never been seen before, and if seen, never in this much detail. Where some parts of their work is considered intellectual property and therefore proprietary, subjective discussions provide readers with challenging theories and ideologies for their own use. Other parts certainly are not, and hopefully some, if not all, of the work contained in this book will be published again and again, in the same way that Gerald Appel’s MACD indicator was 40 years ago.
