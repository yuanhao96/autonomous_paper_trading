Chapter 2 we discussed that, at the very least, we had to beat the 6 percent annual return from a 10-year U.S. government bond. That’s because buying those bonds would earn us 6 percent without having to take any risk. Since earning 10 percent is clearly more than earning 6 percent, ipso fatso, is it then true that paying $12 for a share that earns $1.20 a good deal? Well, life isn’t quite that simple (but as we’ll see in a later chapter, almost!). The bottom line is—we’re off to a great start, but we have to consider a few more things before we can make up our mind. First, $1.20 per share is what Jason’s Gum Shops earned last year. We have to determine whether we think the business will earn that $1.20 in the coming year—or more than that—or maybe less. Last year’s earnings may be a good starting point for estimating next year’s earnings, but it may not. If Jason’s Gum Shops doesn’t earn $1.20 next year, the business won’t be earning that 10 percent T H E L I T T L E B O O K T H AT B E ATS T H E M A R K E T [23] we expected on the $12 per share we just paid—it could be higher—but it could be lower. Second, once we come up with our estimate for how much Jason’s business will earn next year, we have to determine how confident we are in our prediction. If we’re taking a wild guess because we have no idea whether gum sales are steady from year to year, whether Jason’s gum stores are just a fad, or whether new competition from other candy stores will affect Jason’s profits, then our estimate may be suspect. But we have to be reasonable. If we’re not sure whether earnings will be $1.50 or $2.00 per share, that kind of uncertainty is fine. Both of those numbers will represent that Jason’s business is earning more than that 10 percent on our initial $12-per-share cost. On the other hand, if we’re uncertain whether the earnings will be 20 cents per share or $1.20, then our guaranteed 6 percent from the government bond may start to look a whole lot better. The third little detail we haven’t yet considered is that next year is only one year. Even if Jason’s Gum Shops earns $1.20 next year (or a lot more or a lot less), what about all the years after that? Will earnings keep growing every year? Maybe each store will keep selling more gum each year, and earnings will increase that way. Or maybe if 10 stores can make $1.20 per share, getting to 20 stores [24] J O E L G R E E N B LAT T in a few years will cause earnings to grow to $2.40 per share or even higher? Of course, the gum business could always turn sour (sorry) in the next few years, causing gum earnings to remain stuck at levels well below $1.20 for a long time. And there’s more . . . Okay, you’re beginning to panic. I can feel it. This stuff is too hard. How are you going to figure it all out? How can anyone? And even if you take your best shot, am I expecting you (and my kids, for that matter) to “gamble” real money on a pile of guesses and estimates? And, oh yeah, aren’t there tons of MBAs, PhDs, smart financial types, and professional investment analysts, not to mention full-time money managers, trying to figure out pretty much the same things? How can little old you compete with all those hardworking, smart, sophisticated guys? All right already, enough, calm down. Sheesh, can’t I take you anywhere? Have a little faith. Hang in there. I’ll do that summary thing, tell you what’s important to remember, and we’ll move on. Man, if I have to hold your hand for every little thing . . . So, here’s what you need to know: 1. Buying a share in a business means you are purchasing a portion (or percentage interest) of that business. You are then entitled to a portion of that business’s future earnings. T H E L I T T L E B O O K T H AT B E ATS T H E M A R K E T [25] 2. Figuring out what a business is worth involves estimating (okay, guessing) how much the business will earn in the future. 3. The earnings from your share of the profits must give you more money than you would receive by placing that same amount of money in a risk-free 10-year U.S. government bond. (Remember: Last chapter we set 6 percent as your absolute minimum annual return when government bond rates fall below 6 percent) and 4. No, I haven’t forgotten about the magic formula. But you’re going to have to stop bugging me about it, okay? Sheesh! Chapter Four GREAT, FIGURING OUT WHAT A BUSINESS is worth isn’t easy. After lots of guessing and estimating, maybe you get it right and maybe you get it wrong. But what if you could? What if you could figure out what a business was really worth? Is there something you could do with that information? Is there really a place like I promised in the first chapter, a place where you can buy a business for half its true value? A place where you can get $1,000 of value for only $500? You bet there is. But first, let’s spend a few minutes in business school. For the past nine years, I have taught an investing course to a group of graduate business students at an Ivy League university. Needless to say, this is a pretty smart T H E L I T T L E B O O K T H AT B E ATS T H E M A R K E T [27] group of students. Each year, on the first day of class, I walk in and open the newspaper to the financial section. Found there are pages and pages of tables with lots of numbers in tiny print. (Sounds great so far, right?) Anyway, posted in these tables is a list of company names, and next to each name is a bunch of prices. “Call out the name of a big, well-known company,” I say. The students come up with companies like General Electric, IBM, General Motors, and Abercrombie & Fitch. Actually, it doesn’t really matter what companies the students shout out. My main point is so easy to make, any company name in almost any industry, large or small, well-known or not, will do. The result is always the same. I look in the paper next to General Electric and read off the numbers. “It says here that the price for one share of General Electric was $35 yesterday. It also says he
