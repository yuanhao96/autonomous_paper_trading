PART I " 4 * SOLON'S WARNING - SKEWNESS, A S Y M M E T R Y , INDUCTION f roesus, King of Lydia, was considered the richest man of his time. C To this day Romance languages use the expression "rich as Croesus" to describe a person of excessive wealth. He was said to be visited by Solon, the Greek legislator known for his dignity, reserve, upright morals, humility, frugality, wisdom, intelligence, and courage. Solon did not display the smallest surprise at the wealth and splendor surrounding his host, nor the tiniest admiration for their owner. Croesus was so irked by the manifest lack of impression on the part of this illustrious visitor that he attempted to extract from him some acknowledgment. He asked him if he had known a happier man than him. Solon cited the life of a man who led a noble life and died while in battle. Prodded for more, he gave similar examples of heroic but terminated lives, until Croesus, irate, asked him point-blank if he was not to be considered the happiest man of all. Solon answered: "The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has [guaranteed] continued happiness until the end we may call happy."1 The modern equivalent has been no less eloquently voiced by the baseball coach Yogi Berra, who seems to have translated Solon's 10 SOLON'S WARNING outburst from the pure Attic Greek into no less pure Brooklyn English with "it ain't over until it's over", or, in a less dignified manner, with "it ain't over until the fat lady sings". In addition, aside from his use of the vernacular, the Yogi Berra quote presents an advantage of being true, while the meeting between Croesus and Solon was one of these historical facts that benefited from the imagination of the chroniclers, as it was chronologically impossible for the two men to have been in the same location.
