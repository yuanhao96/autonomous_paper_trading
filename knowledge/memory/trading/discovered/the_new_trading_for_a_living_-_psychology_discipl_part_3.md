Chapter 21, “Computers in Trading,” â†œbut here it is in brief. There are three types of trading software: toolboxes, black boxes, and gray boxes. A toolbox allows you to display data, draw charts, plot indicators, change their parameters, and test your trading systems. Toolboxes for options traders include option valuation models. Adapting a good toolbox to your needs can be as easy as adjusting the seat of your car. In 1977, I bought the first ever toolbox for computerized technical analysis. It cost $1,900 plus monthly data fees. Today, inexpensive, and even free, software places powerful tools at everyone’s fingertips. I illustrated most of the concepts in this book using Stockcharts.com because I wanted my new book to be useful to as many traders as possible. Stockcharts.com evens out the playing field for traders. It is clear, intuitive, and rich in features. Its basic version is free, although I used its inexpensive “members’ version” for higher quality charting. I still remember how hard it was in the beginning and want to show you how much analytic power you can have for free or at a very minimal cost. What goes on inside a black box is secret.You feed it data, and it tells you what and when to buy and sell. It is like magic—a way to make money without thinking. Black boxes are usually sold with excellent historical track records. This is only natural because they were created to fit old data. Markets keep changing, and black boxes keep blowing up, but new generations of losers keep buying them. If you’re in the market for a black box, remember that there is a guy in Brooklyn who has a bridge for sale. Get More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com 14. THE MARKET CROWN AND YOU 39 Gray boxes straddle the fence between toolboxes and black boxes. These packages are usually put out by prominent market personalities.They disclose the general logic of their system and allow you to adjust some of their parameters. Advisors Some newsletters provide useful ideas and point readers in the direction of trading opportunities. A few offer educational value. Most sell an illusion of being an insider. Newsletters are good entertainment. Your subscription rents you a pen pal who sends often amusing and interesting letters and never asks you to write back, except for a check at renewal time. Freedom of the press in the United States allows even a convicted felon to go online and start sending out a financial advisory letter. Quite a few of them do. The “track records” of various newsletters are largely an exercise in futility because hardly anybody takes every trade suggested by a newsletter. Services that rate newsletters are for-profit affairs run by small businessmen whose wellbeing depends on the well-being of the advisory industry. Rating services may occasionally tut-tut an advisor, but they dedicate most of their energy to loud cheerleading. I used to write an advisory newsletter decades ago: worked hard, delivered straight talk, and received good ratings. I saw from the inside a tremendous potential for fudging results. This is a well-kept secret of the advisory industry. After looking at my letters, a prominent advisor told me that I should spend less time on research and more on marketing. The first principle of letter writing is: “If you have to make forecasts, make a lot of them.” â•›Whenever a forecast turns out right, double the volume of promotional mail. ■■14. The Market Crowd and You Markets are loosely organized crowds whose members bet that prices will rise or fall. Since each price represents crowd consensus at the moment of transaction, traders are betting on the future opinion and mood of the crowd. The crowd keeps swinging from hope to fear and from indifference to optimism or pessimism. Most people don’t follow their own trading plans because they get swept up in the crowd’s feelings and actions. As bulls and bears battle in the market, the value of your open positions soars or sinks, depending on the actions of total strangers.You can’t control the markets. You can only set your position size and decide whether and when to enter or exit your trades. Most traders feel jittery entering a trade. Their judgment becomes clouded after they join the crowd. Caught up in crowd emotions, many traders deviate from their plans and lose money. 40 MASS PSYCHOLOGY Experts on Crowds Charles Mackay, a Scottish barrister, wrote his classic book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, in 1841. He described several mass manias, including the Tulip Mania in Holland in 1634 and the South Seas investment bubble in England in 1720. The tulip craze began as a bull market in tulip bulbs.The long bull market convinced the prosperous Dutch that tulips would continue to appreciate. Many abandoned their businesses to grow tulips, trade them, or become tulip brokers. Banks accepted tulips as collateral and speculators profited. Finally, that mania collapsed in waves of panic selling, leaving people destitute and the nation shocked. Mackay sighed, “Men go mad in crowds, and they come back to their senses slowly and one by one.” In 1897, Gustave LeBon, a French philosopher and politician, wrote The Crowd. A trader who reads it today can see his reflection in a century-old mirror. LeBon wrote that when people gather in a crowd, “Whoever be the individuals that compose it, however like or unlike be their mode of life, their occupations, their character, or their intelligence, the fact that they have been transformed into a crowd puts them in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes them feel, think, and act in a manner quite different from that in which each individual of them would feel, think, and act were he in a state of isolation.” People change when they join crowds. They become more credulous and impulsive, anxiously search for a leader, and react to emotions instead of using their intellect. An individual who becomes involved in a group becomes less capable
