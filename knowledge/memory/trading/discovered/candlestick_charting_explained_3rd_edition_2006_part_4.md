Chapter 10. As is the accepted standard, and certainly in this case the fact, whatever factual errors and omissions are sadly, but most certainly, my own. This page intentionally left blank CANDLESTICK CHARTING EXPLAINED This page intentionally left blank CHAPTER ONE Introduction Japanese candlestick analysis is a valid form of technical analysis and should be treated as such. Promoters of instant wealth will always misdirect and abuse their rights, but in the end, they are not around long enough to cause any substantial damage. One should always look into any new technique with a healthy amount of skepticism. Hopefully, this book will keep that skepticism under control and unnecessary. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS When considering technical analysis, one should remember that things are quite often not always what they seem. Many facts that we learn are not actually true; and what seems to be the obvious, sometimes is not. Many people believe water runs out of a bathtub faster as it gets to the end; it doesn’t. Some people may drink like a fish, but fish don’t drink. George Washington neither cut down a cherry tree, nor threw a silver dollar across the Potomac. Dogs don’t sweat through their 䊏 1 䊏 䊏 2 Chapter One tongues, Audi automobiles never mysteriously accelerated, and the Battle of Bunker Hill was not fought at Bunker Hill (Breed’s Hill). A good detective will tell you that some of the least reliable information comes from eye witnesses. When people observe an event, it seems their background, education, and other influences color their perception of what occurred. A most important thing that detectives try to do at a crime scene is to prevent the observers from talking to each other, because most would be influenced but what others say they saw. Another curious human failing becomes a factor when we observe facts. The human mind does not handle large numbers or macro ideas well. That thousands of people die each year from automobile accidents raises scarcely an eyebrow, but one airplane crash, killing only a few people, grabs the nation. We are only modestly concerned that tens of thousands of people are infected with AIDS, but we are touched deeply when presented with an innocent child that has been indirectly infected. If a situation is personalized, we can focus on it. We can become deluded by our emotions, and these emotions can affect our perceptions. When our portfolios are plunging, all of the fears that we can imagine are dragged out: recession, debt, war, budget, bank failures, etc. Something is needed to keep us from falling victim to everyday emotion and delusion; that something is technical analysis. Almost all methods of technical analysis generate useful information, which, if used for nothing more than uncovering and organizing facts about market behavior, will increase the investor’s understanding of the markets. The investor is made painfully aware that technical competence does not ensure competent trading. Speculators who lose money do so not only because of bad analysis, but because of their inability to transform their analysis into sound practice. Bridging the vital gap between analysis and action requires overcoming the threats of fear, greed, and hope. It means controlling impatience and 3 䊏 Introduction the desire to stray away from a sound method to something new during times of temporary adversity. It means having the discipline to believe what you see and to follow the indications from sound methods, even though they contradict what everyone else is saying or what seems to be the correct course of action. JAPANESE CANDLESTICK ANALYSIS As a new and exciting dimension of technical analysis, Japanese candlestick charting and candle pattern analysis will help people who wish to have another tool at their disposal; this tool will help sort and control the constant disruptions and continuous outside influences on sound stock and futures market analysis. What does candlestick charting offer that typical Western highlow bar charts do not? As far as actual data displayed—nothing. However, when it comes to visual appeal and the ability to see data relationships easier, candlesticks are exceptional. A quick insight to the recent trading psychology is there before you. After a minimal amount of practice and familiarization, candlesticks will become part of your analysis arsenal. You may never return to a standard bar chart. Japanese candlesticks offer a quick picture into the psychology of short-term trading, studying the effect, not the cause. This places candlesticks squarely in the category of technical analysis. One cannot ignore the fact that prices are influenced by investors’ psychologically driven emotions of fear, greed, and hope. The overall psychology of the marketplace cannot be measured by statistics; some form of technical analysis must be used to analyze the changes in these psychological factors. Japanese candlesticks read the changes in the makeup of investors’ interpretations of value. This is then reflected in price 䊏 4 Chapter One movement. More than just a method of pattern recognition, candlesticks show the interactions between buyers and sellers. Japanese candlestick charting provides insight into the financial markets that is not readily available with other charting methods. It works well with either stocks or commodities. Related analysis techniques, such as candlestick filtering and CandlePower (candle volume) charting, will add to your analysis and timing capabilities. This book not only will serve as a complete guide to Japanese candlestick charting and candle pattern analysis, but will also provide conclusive evidence of the usefulness of candlestick patterns as an analysis tool. All methods of analysis and all assumptions will be opened and unobstructed. You will, after reading this book, either begin to use candlesticks to assist in your market analysis and timing or be confident enough in them to further your own research into candlestick ana
