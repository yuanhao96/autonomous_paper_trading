Chapter 9. Trade Imports Flows: Measuring Exports versus Trade flows are the basis of the international transactions. Just its the investment environment of a given economy is a prime determinant of its currency valuation, trade flows represent a country's net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters— meaning they export more to international clients than they import from international producers will experience a net trade surplus. Countries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value, since from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought more than it is sold: inclinational clients intended in buying the exported product/service mast first buy the appropriate currency, thus creating demand for the currency of the exporter. Countries that are net importers—meaning they make more International purchases than international sales experience what is known as a trade deficit, which in turn has the potential to drive the value of the currency down. In order to engage in international purchases, importers must sell their currency to purchase that of the 32 retailer of the good or service; accordingly, on a large scale this could have the effect of driving the currency down. This concept is important because it is a primary reason why many economists say that the dollar needs to continue to fall over the next few years to slop the United States from repeatedly hitting record high trade deficits. To clarify this further, suppose, for example, that the U.K. economy is booming, and that its stock market is rallying as well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a lackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In such a scenario, the natural result would be for U.S. residents to sell their dollars and buy British pounds to take advantage of the rallying U.K. economy. This would result in capital outflow from the United States and capital inflow for the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective, this would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP as demand for USD declines and demand for GBP increases; in other words, the GBP/USD would rise. For day and swing traders, a tip for keeping on top of the broader economic picture is to figure out how economic data for a particular country stacks up. Trading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises A good tip for traders is to stack up economic data surprises against price action to help explain and forecast the future movement in currencies. Figure 3.2 Charting Economic Surprises Figure 3.2 presents a sample of what can be done. The bar graph shows the percentages of surprise that economic indicator have compared to consensus forecasts, while the dark line traces price action for the period during which the data 33 was released; the white line is a simple price regression line. This charting can be done for all of the major currency pairs, providing a visual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic fundamentals and helping to forecast future price action. Thus data is provided on a monthly basis on www.dailyfx.com, listed under Charting Economic Fundamentals. According to the chart in Figure 3.2 in November 2004, there were 12 out of 15 positive economic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month of December, which was the month during which the economic data was released. Although this methodology is inexact, the analysis is simple and past charts have yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows how the EUR/USD moved in the following month. As you can see, the EUR/USD quickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental divergence of price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful to dollar longs, who harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large part of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called "variant perception", was invented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced 24 percent average rates of return for 30 consecutive years. Figure 3.3 EUR/USD Chart (Source: eSignal. www.eSignal.com) While those charts rarely offer such clear-cut signals, their analytical value may also lie in spotting and interpreting the outlier data. Very large positive and negative surprises of particular economic statistics can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back and look at the EUR/USD charts, you will see that the dollar plunged between October and December. This was triggered by a widening of the current account deficit to a record high in October 2004. Economic fundamentals matter perhaps more in the foreign exchange market than in any other market, and charts 34 such as these could provide valuable clues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indicators are chosen for each region and then a price regression line is superimposed over the past 20 days of price data. Technical Analysis Prior to the mid-1980s, the FX market was primarily dominated by fundamental traders. However, with the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies, the influence of technical trading on the FX market has increased significantly. The availability of high leverage has led to an increased number of momentum or model funds, which have become important participants in the FX market with the ability to influence currency prices. Technical analysis focuses on the study of price movements. Technical analysis use historical currency data to forecast the direction of future prices. The premise of technical analysis is that all current market information is already reflected in the price of each currency; therefore, studying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In addition, technical analysis works under the assumption that history tends to repeat itself. Technical analysis is a very popular tool f
