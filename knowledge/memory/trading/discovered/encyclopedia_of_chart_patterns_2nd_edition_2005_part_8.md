Chapter 32 on the measured move down for more information. Shorting a stock is not for the novice. It entails unlimited risk as Don discovered in the first sample trade. However, if you discover a downgrade with an upward breakout that rounds over, keep this chapter in mind. Do your homework on the fundamentals and make sure you have valid technical and fundaments reasons for shorting a stock. Use proper money management techniques to limit losses if you decide to trade it. For Best Performance The following list includes tips and observations that may help you select patterns to improve your trading performance. Refer to the associated table for more information. 4366_62.qxd 2/23/05 12:27 PM Page 949 For Best Performance 949 • Use the identification guidelines to select a tradable pattern—Table 62.1. • Select downgrades that have a wide intraday trading range, 2 or 3 times the monthly average—Table 62.1. • Sell short a downward breakout in a bear market, not in a bull market—Table 62.2. • If a busted pattern appears, trade it, because price moving less than 5% in the breakout direction before reversing suggests that the new trend may be a strong one—Table 62.2. • Select patterns with downward breakouts in a bear market. They have the lowest failure rates for moves up to 20%—Table 62.3. • The best performance comes from downgrades near the yearly low. Stocks making new lows tend to continue making new lows—Table 62.4. • When a pullback occurs, performance suffers. Look for nearby underlying support before trading—Table 62.4. • Half the downgrades reach the ultimate high or low in a week or two. Almost two-thirds reverse in less than 3 weeks—Table 62.5. • Tall patterns perform better than short ones—Table 62.6. 4366_63.qxd 2/23/05 12:26 PM Page 950 63 Stock Upgrades RESULTS SNAPSHOT Upward Breakouts Event A broker upgrades the stock and price breaks out upward.

Tall patterns perform better than short ones. Price drops by at least 20% within 2 weeks in nearly half the patterns. Downward Breakouts Event Same, but breakout is downward. Reversal or continuation Short-term bearish continuation 950 4366_63.qxd 2/23/05 12:26 PM Page 951 Tour 951 Bull Market Bear Market Performance rank 5 out of 5 2 out of 4 Break-even failure rate 38% 23% Average decline 12% 18% Change after trend ends 44% 35% Volume trend Same as for upward breakouts Pullbacks 37% 17% Percentage meeting price target 67% 77% Surprising findings Tall patterns perform better than short ones. The stock drops after the upgrade 35% of the time. Half surge upward within a week. What happens to price after a broker upgrades a stock? Stock upgrades should be good for the stock and good for the owners of the stock. Right? Well, not always. The Results Snapshot begins to tell the story. After the upgrade, anything can happen. For example, suppose you own a stock in XYZ Company and a broker upgrades the stock. You hear about the announcement on the television or read about it in the newspaper the next day. Which way will price move? About two out of three times (65%), the stock will move higher, as expected, and break out upward, climbing an average of 24% in a bull market. Then price tumbles 30%, giving back its gains and more. If the stock has a downward breakout, expect price to continue moving down an average of 12% in a bull market before the decline stops. Then price climbs by 44%. Both breakout directions spell a trading opportunity, but not in the direction you expect. More about the new trading patterns later. Surprising findings include the usual culprits and new ones as well. A large number (35%) of stocks have downward breakouts after an upgrade. If the breakout is downward, over half begin a sustained rise (over 20%) within a week. For upward breakouts, the reverse is true: Nearly half decline substantially (over 20%) within 2 weeks. I discuss these surprises later in the chapter. Tour Figure 63.1 shows what I expected to see after a brokerage firm upgraded Dell. On the day of the announcement, price closed at the daily high. On succeeding days, prices climbed even higher and then took a rest for a week or so 4366_63.qxd 2/23/05 12:26 PM 952 Page 952 Stock Upgrades Dell, Inc.

This stair-step pattern continued until October when price reached the ultimate high. The breakout price was 3.75 and price completed its climb at 12.98, for a gain of 246%. That is how I thought the pattern would work and in a few cases, it did. The figure shows the best performing stock in the database for this pattern. Most of the time, though, you will be disappointed. A stock upgrade is often a premature sell signal. In the majority of the patterns I looked at, prices either dropped immediately or declined within 3 weeks. Thus, if a brokerage firm upgrades a stock you own, be ready to sell. It is not an automatic sell as it might turn out like Figure 63.1. If the stock drops after the upgrade, wait for a buying opportunity. Identification Guidelines Figure 63.2 shows a typical example of a pattern I discovered when researching what happens after a stock upgrade. Most of the time, the stock climbs after the announcement. Thus, the breakout is upward, signaled when price closes above the daily high posted on the day of the upgrade. Price continues climbing, usually in a stair-step pattern. In this figure, prices climbed just 11%. Then the world ended and prices tumble
