Chapter 3, a freely fluctuating exchange rate system is inherently unstable because of the influence of trend-following speculation, yet speculators follow the correct strategy by following the trend. Judging by the public reaction-which consists mainly of comments by journalists who read the book superficially or not at allI have not been successful in demonstrating the significance of reflexivity. Only the iirst part of my argument-that the prevailing bias affects market prices-seems to have registered. The second part-that the prevailing bias can in certain circumstances also affect the so-called fundamentals and changes in market prices cause changes in market prices-seems to have gone unnoticed. The fault is at least partially mine. Since reflexivity changes the structure of events, I have tried to put forward a reflexive structure as the universally valid way of looking at the evolution of market prices-a kind of general theory h la Keynes in which the absence of reflexivity constitutes a special case. It would have been better to present reflexivity as the special case because what endows reflexivity with significance is the fact that it operates intermittently. Preface 9 Once the significance of reflexivity has sunk in and the inadequacy of the prevailing wisdom has been recognized, the time would have been ripe for proposing a general theory of reflexivity. I have my excuses. I did not observe reflexivity in financial markets but developed reflexivity as an abstract philosophical concept before I entered the financial markets. In other words, I failed as a philosophical speculptor before I succeeded as a financial one. Apparently, my failure as a philosopher carried over into my book because I did not make the concept of reflexivity-which can be observed and converted into profit-as clear as it could be. When one discovers something new, one has an understandable inclinaaon to exaggerate it$ importance. This is what I did with reiiexivity. By proposing a general theory of reflexivity, I may have gone too far too soon. I claimed that economic theory is false and social science is a false metaphor. These are exaggerated claims. Since farfrom-equilibrium conditions arise only intermittently, economic theory is only intermittently false. And the dividing line between natural and social sqience is not quite as hard and fast as I made it appear when I wrote the book. These qualifications render reflexivity more rather than less significant. Once the concept of reflexivity is established, the range of its applicability seems to widen. It is possible to treat the evolution of prices in all financial markets taken together as a reflexive, historical process. I have done so in The Alchemy of Finance when I analyzed Reagan's "Imperial Circle," and I have found other examples since the book was published, such as the German Imperial Circle after the fall of the Berlin Wall. (See appendix: "The Prospect of European Disintegration.") But there is a danger in pushing the concept oi reflexivity too far, as I nave learned at my owri expefiac. There are lohg fallow periods when the movements in financial markets do not seem to follow a reflexive tune but rather resemble the random walks mandated by the efficient market theory. In these circumstances, it is better to do nothing than to pursue a ref lexive hypothesis. Treating reflexivity as an intermittent phenomenon rather than as a universally valid condition opens up fertile fields for investigation. For instance, the question poses itself: How can near- and farfrom-equilibrium conditions be distinguished from each other? What is the criterion of demarcation? I have done a lot of thinking on that question and I have the beginnings of an answer. Whether 10 4 Preface I can formulate it properly remains to be seen in my next book. It revolves around a question of values and it is relevant for society in general, not only for financial markets. My next book, if it is ever written, will be a theory of history, not a theory of finance. I am providing an example of how the boom-bust pattern of financial markets can be applied to larger historical processes in the appendix where I reproduce a lecture I delivered on September 29, 1993, entitled "Prospect for European Disintegration." INTRODUCTION In a very real sense, this book is my life's work. It touches on many of my most abiding interests and it brings together the two main strands in my 'intellectual development: one abstract and one practical. The abstract came' first. Ever since I became conscious of my existence I have had a passionate interest in understanding it, and 1 regarded my own 'understanding as the central problem that needed to be understood. To understand oneself-gnote aucton; nosce te ipsum-is an impossible task.

As an undergraduate I studied economics, but I found economic theory highly unsatisfactory because it failed to come to grips with th$problem; indeed, it went through great contortions to avoid it. Economics seeks to be a science. Science is supposed to be objective and it is difficult to be scientific when the subject matter, the participant in the economic process, lacks objectivity. I was greatly influenced at the time by Karl Popper's ideas on scientific method. I accepted most of his views, with one major exception. He argued in favor of what he called "unity of methodH1-that is, the methods and criteria that apply to the study of natural phenomena also apply to the study of social events. I felt that there was a fundamental difference between the v- 12 t I Introduction two: the events studied by the social sciences have thinking particip
