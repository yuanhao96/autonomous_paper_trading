Part VI). Although their trading methods are completely different-Trout is a directional trader, whereas Hull is an arbi-trageur-their assessments of the key to successful trading are virtually identical: a combination of having an edge and using rigid money management controls. 70 71 AlWeiss: The Human Chart Encyclopedia In terms of return/risk ratio, Al Weiss may well have the single best long-term track record for a commodity trading advisor. Since he began trading in 1982 as AZF Commodity Management, Weiss has averaged 52 percent annually. One thousand dollars invested with Weiss in 1982 would have been worth almost $53,000 at the end of 1991. However, returns are only half the story. The truly impressive element in Weiss's track record is that these high gains were achieved with extremely small equity drawdowns. During this entire period, the largest single equity drawdown witnessed by Weiss was 17 percent in 1986. In the past four years (1988-91), Weiss has honed his risk control to truly astounding standards: during this period, his worst annual drawdown averaged under 5 percent, while his average annual return exceeded 29 percent. Despite his exemplary track record, Weiss has kept a very low profile. Until 1991, Weiss repeatedly refused to grant any interviews. He explains this by saying, "I didn't feel my methods were proven until I had realized at least a decade of superior performance." He also felt that interviews would attract the wrong type of investors. At this point, that consideration is no longer a concern, as Weiss is handling as much money as he feels he can manage without negatively affecting his performance (approximately $100 million). Although Weiss now regularly turns away new investors, he will occasionally make an exception. As he explains, "Sometimes I take on a small account [$100,000] if I feel the person is truly sincere. I still get a kick out of taking on a small account and making it compound. Just recently, I accepted a new investor because I was impressed that he had gone through the track records of five hundred CTAs before making a selection. Ironically, at the same time I was talking to this person. I also received a call from a French bank that wanted to invest $30 million. I turned down the bank, but I accepted the small account's $100,000 investment." Weiss has also shunned publicity because he is naturally reclusive. He admits that, during the decade he has been managing investor funds, he has met only five of his clients. Although Weiss comes across as an extrovert over the phone, in person his shy side dominates. One of Weiss's hobbies is investing with other traders. He devotes one or two days per month to this endeavor. He estimates that, over the years, he has reviewed the track records of approximately eight hundred traders. Out of this large group, he has selected about twenty traders for personal investment. His goal is not to pick any individual supertraders but rather to blend traders together in a group whose composite performance reflects both good returns and very low equity drawdowns. Interestingly, the performance characteristics of this group of traders as a whole has the appearance of a Weiss clone. During the period 1988-91, the group realized an average annual return of 19 percent, with an extraordinarily low average maximum annual drawdown under 3 percent. The ratio of these two numbers (19/3 = 6.3) is nearly identical to the ratio of Weiss's corresponding figures for the same period (29/5 = 5.8). My interview of Weiss proved to be one of the most difficult I have conducted. Quite frankly, had I been less impressed with his track record, I would have given up on this chapter. After virtually every question I posed, Weiss would go off on elaborate tangents and ultimately catch himself, stop talking, and glance at me with a look that seemed to say, "stop me before I digress any further." The interview was such an obvious flop to both of us that we decided to break and go for dinner. In other interviews, I have taken my tape recorder along in such situations, and sections of past interviews have, in fact, transpired over meals. However, in this instance, the prospects seemed so unencouraging that I deliberately left the recorder in my room. I also felt that some casual conversation might help break the ice. After dinner, we decided to give it another shot by trying to continue the interview on an evening walk. The atmosphere was conducive to conversation, as we strolled along the quiet streets of a small island just off the coast of Florida, on a mild, winter evening. Nevertheless, the interview still proceeded in very jagged fashion. I found myself constantly turning the tape recorder on and off. Following are excerpts gleaned from our conversations and some additional material from follow-up correspondence. ==== How did you end up becoming a trader? ==== It was not an overnight process. I spent four years of solid research before doing any serious trading. After literally thousands of hours of poring over charts, going back as far in history as I could, I began to recognize certain patterns that became the basis of my trading approach. ==== You spent four years doing research before you even started trading? ==== Yes. I'm a risk-averse person. I wanted to have confidence in my approach before I started. ==== Precisely how far back did you go in your chart studies? ==== It varied with the individual market and the available charts. In the case of the grain markets, I was able to go back as far as the 1840s. ==== Was it really necessary to go back that far? ==== Absolutely. One of me keys in long-term chart analysis is realizing that markets behave differently in different economic cycles. Recognizing these repeating and shifting long-term patterns requires lots of history. Identifying where you are in an economic cycle-say, an inflationary phase versus a deflationary phase-is critical to interpreting the chart patterns evolving
