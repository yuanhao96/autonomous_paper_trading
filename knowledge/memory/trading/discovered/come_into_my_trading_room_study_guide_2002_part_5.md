Chapter 6 (pages 121–134). Additional Reading Elder, Alexander. Trading for a Living (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1993). See “Triple Screen Trading System” (pages 235–243). Kaufman, Perry J. Smarter Trading (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995). Schwager, Jack D. Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1995). S I X DAY-TRADING Answer 48 D. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. In day-trading, profits are smaller and expenses are higher. There are long periods of “dead time,” but when a signal comes, you must recognize it instantly and trade without pausing to ruminate. Losses are generally smaller than in position trading because losing trades are closed out no later than at the end of the day. Answer 49 C. 1 and 4. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. Day-trading demands a much higher degree of concentration than position trading because it does not leave you time to think. Impulsivity is deadly because you have no time to correct your mistakes. Daytrading is an expensive proposition that generates high commissions and leads to purchases of software, data, and other tools, that are the main reasons why brokers and vendors love it. To succeed, you must face your impulsivity and work to reduce it. A written trading plan is a useful step in that direction. 115 116 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Answer 50 2. Penny stocks are unsuitable for day-trading. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. The two essential criteria for choosing day-trading stocks are liquidity and volatility. You can find stocks that keep making big moves on high volume among the most actives or the most popular stocks. Penny stocks may be promising for investors, but are not good for day-traders because of their narrow intraday ranges and low liquidity. Answer 51 1. D 2. E 3. C 4. B 5. A Give yourself a point for each correct answer. The intraday volume curve is normally U-shaped—highest during the first and last half-hours of trading. Early in the session outsiders crowd into the market, and by the end of the day the pros dominate the action. A wide opening range may define the high and the low of the day, but prices are likely to break out of a narrow opening range. Answer 52 1. B 2. A 3. D, E, F, G 4. C 5. C-H DAY-TRADING 117 Give yourself a point for each correct answer (half a point if you missed one of several occurrences). Add two points if you got the bonus question right, or a point for getting it partly right. When a downward gap first appears, it is hard to tell whether it is a continuation of the downtrend or an exhaustion move prior to an upside reversal. The downside breakout from the opening range confirms the downtrend and gives the first good shorting signal of the day. The deepening bottoms of MACD-Histogram show that the bears are growing stronger and lead one to expect lower prices ahead. Rallies to the EMA create shorting opportunities throughout the day. During the last hour of trading prices dip to a new low, while MACD-Histogram traces a higher bottom. This bullish divergence gives a buy signal—time to take profits on shorts. At the right edge of the chart—bearish. The trend is down, and prices closed near the lows; expect a lower opening tomorrow. The beauty of day-trading is that there is no overnight risk. We can wait for the opening, monitor the opening range, and then trade the breakout. Answer 53 C. 1, 2, and 3. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. The best time to make strategic decisions is before the opening—if the stock does this, I will trade this way, and so on. Then, as you review your stocks throughout the day, you are ready to act fast whenever your conditions are met. There is no harm listening to tips, as long as you put them through the same screens as your regular stocks; perhaps they should be added to the regular list. Trading in a room full of people is much more likely to lead to emotional decisions. Successful traders almost always sit at the edge of the trading room, isolating themselves from the masses. 118 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Rating Yourself Below 21 Poor.
