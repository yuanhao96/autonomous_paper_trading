CHAPTER 1 SO YOU WANT TO TRADE FOREX? 5 test done to determine substance.) Taking this personal litmus test forces you to face the brutal reality of whether you are made of “gold” or “fools’ gold.” YOUR PERSONAL LITMUS TEST 1. 2. Are you more honest than dishonest? Do you always tell the truth? or do you exaggerate and make up stuff along the way? As a child, I acquired the habit of exaggerating from my dad. He would exaggerate about nearly everything he did, saw, and experienced. Yet when I challenged him about his falsehoods, his justification was that “exaggerations make the story more interesting.” Not surprisingly, I began to follow in his footsteps. When I began dating my wife, she challenged me about my exaggerations the same way I did my dad. When we were alone, she would calmly say to me, “That didn’t happen that way. When you exaggerate, you are outright lying. That is not a good habit!” Telling the truth is critical. It builds relationships and earns security, trust, and respect from those with whom you associate. It helps others know who you truly are. It also prevents future trading missteps. After you have been taught how to trade, if you are in the habit of exaggerating, you’ll begin to lie to yourself and others about your success. You will lie to yourself about how well you follow the rules when in reality you are trading on emotion and hunches. And if you lie about your level of success, that bad habit will curse you when everyone wants to see proof of your trading prowess. They’ll want to know your secrets of supposed success. Be honest in everything you do! Are you a promise keeper or a promise breaker? Integrity is all about making sure your word equals your deed. If your word does not equal your deed, then you are a promise breaker. No one likes a promise breaker. You will not be able to attract the right people in your life unless you become a promise keeper. When you make commitments to yourself and others, you need to keep them. If you are not a promise keeper, you will bring this bad habit to the trading table and you will not follow the rules as 6 3. 4. THE 10 ESSENTIALS OF FOREX TRADING you trade. You will make promises to yourself and then break them. Believe me when I say that if you promise never to trade without a protective stop-loss order, which is an order that protects you from losing all your money in a single trade, and then break that promise, your career as a trader will quickly be over. Avoid this fate—be a promise keeper. Are you a rule maker or a rule breaker? Freedom is something of a paradox because in order to be free, you must abide by a plethora of rules. Just look at all the rules when driving your car. But the more you obey the rules, the safer you are when driving. Breaking the rules, however, will endanger your life and may cost you your freedom. Our lives are filled with rules. From an early childhood we learn our parents’ household rules. Then we learn rules about school, about dating, about working, about marriage, parenting, and so on. The rules in our life protect us and help us get where we are going faster and safer. Breaking those rules creates risks, problems, and, eventually, setbacks. These setbacks can take you completely off track and dramatically delay you from achieving your goal in a timely manner. Learning to trade, and being successful at it, requires that you follow certain rules. Ignoring the rules will cause you trouble when you are trading. You will be driven by your emotions and will be caught up in chasing the market, changing your mind, and breaking every rule in the book in the spirit of trying to save yourself. Don’t get yourself caught in this position. Are you a good or bad listener? Being a good listener has its rewards. The greatest reward comes to those who develop the art of hearing what is not said. I used to be a bad listener, constantly interrupting people when they were talking and completing their sentences for them. I assumed I already knew what they were going to say and where they were going with the conversation. And yet I was almost always wrong. To overcome this habit, I had to learn to keep my mouth shut until the person speaking to me finished what they were saying. Interrupting someone’s conversation can potentially get the topic off track and plunge all involved into confusion. Imagine the impact of such an interruption on a trade in process. Learning to be a successful trader requires good listening skills. You
