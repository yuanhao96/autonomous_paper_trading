Even those who never plan to trade will find a wealth of information that will make them better investors. This step-by-step guide to less demanding and lower-risk ways to trade or build a currency-diversified investment portfolio offers a less intimidating path to forex profits.” —Yohay Elam, Founder of Forex Crunch “Cliff Wachtel's book provides pragmatic counsel and guidance. A must read for serious investors seeking to diversify beyond stocks, bonds, and gold.” —Dave Lemont, CEO, Currensee “A must read for any informed investor or trader that deserves to become the classic introduction to forex. This book is the ideal shortcut to simpler, safer forex trading or investing. As Cliff succinctly puts it, ‘The need for currency diversification is one of the most important lessons of the Great Financial Crisis.’ This book details—with genuine respect for his readers' money and intelligence—a range of solutions, offering something for readers of every skill level and risk tolerance. Wachtel provides full details and illustrations to show you how to actually make money, without overloading you with secondary details or information you can find elsewhere.” —Eric Harbor, CEO, Caesartrade.com “One of the best starting points I have read about forex. Understanding both the big picture and the essential, practical details of how to identify, plan, and execute a profitable trade is the manna of successful traders. Cliff delivers both. He explains what e. e. cummings called ‘the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life,’ but applied to the forex world. A really good tool, whether you're a newbie forex trader or a long-term traditional investor trying to build a diversified portfolio. Read it and you will get ‘forexpertise.’” —Mauricio Carrillo, FXstreet.com U.S. Manager, @MCarrilloFX “This book is an insightful introduction to the world of forex. Wachtel leads the novice trader on a journey of discovery from the most basic concepts in the forex market to more sophisticated trading strategies. What stands out is his honesty. Wachtel doesn't sugarcoat the FX market; instead he shares the idiosyncrasies of this market and debunks a few FX myths along the way. He also introduces some of the latest developments in the retail forex market, from social trading to binary options. Wachtel's broad knowledge of this market makes this book an interesting read for those who want a thorough insight into the world of FX.” —Kathleen Brooks, Research Director, Forex.com “In an ever-evolving field, it's rare to find a guidebook so helpful and timeless as Cliff Wachtel's Sensible Guide to Forex. This book gives both current traders and new traders the perspective they need to take their forex trading to the next level.” —Tal Holtzer, CEO, DailyForex.com “This is a fantastic, comprehensive, and up-to-date overview and practical guide to succeeding in the foreign exchange market, with an insightful, qualitative, and nonintimidating approach. Whether you are a novice considering a move into the foreign exchange market or an experienced trader looking for a deeper understanding of various concepts or some new approaches, Cliff's book does a stellar job of covering all the bases.” —Joel Kruger, Currency Strategist, FXCM “Cliff's book is a must-read, cogent, cohesive compendium of the realities of forex. I've been in the trading business for 35+ years and believe that success is all about intelligent risk management. The book's relentless emphasis on risk and money management is the reason that this is the first investment book I've bothered to finish in the past 20 years. For the novice, first he arms you with the relevant information to keep you from immediately losing your shirt, so that you survive the learning process with most of your cash and confidence intact. Then he takes you step-by-step through a number of paths to profitability. For the professional, he reminds us of the rules we all strive not to violate every day because we're human. He also provides the first in-depth coverage of two new and potentially very useful ways to tap forex—social trading and binary options. This book is the only source I've found for in-depth and objective coverage of either of these intriguing new ways to trade forex markets with potentially less effort and better returns.” —David Israel, Chief Market Strategist, White Wave Trading Strategies, Ltd. www.whitewavetradingstrategies.com Founded in 1807, John Wiley & Sons is the oldest independent publishing company in the United States.
