on price action on the charts to detemline when to trade and when not to trade. This is the assumption behind Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, a technical system. l.f you are a fundamental trader, my sugges­ tion would be to combine the technical and fundamental analysis together as part of your trading system. Remember, your trading system has to be something you are comfortable with and fits your �personaUty." Anything short of that will befa.il.ure. Now, we are going to proceed forward and start to create the founda­ tion "blocks" for you to become a professional trader using the Tchimoku Kinko Byo system. C O �I"ONIlNl'S O F A TRAilING S\'S'I'IC�I Trading a.nd investing a.re very simple processes and we human be­ nalely, we have a lol oj biases thal enler into trading decisions. ings try to make it 'into something much more complex. U1ifortu­ f bel.ieve people get exaclfy what lhey want out of lhe markets and most people are afraid of success orJa.ilure. As a resull, they tend to resist clwnge and continue to follow their natural. biases and lose 'in the ma,rkets. When you get lid oj the fem', you tend to get lid of the biases. As Jor risk, most people don't understand 'it, including a lot of professionals, and what's really interest'ing is that once you under­ stand risk and portfolio management, you can design Q, tmding sys­ tem with al,most any IlJVel oj pe1jOl'lnance. -Van K. Tharp Backgl'ollnd People can leam a lot about life b y observing nature's creatures, obser­ vations that can benefit every aspect of someone's life. Let us examine a cougar and how it hWlts for prey. The cougar is one of nature's fiercest creatures. When hWlting for prey, a cougar is strategic. If a cougar fInds a herd of deer, it will wait patiently observing the entire herd looking for th e weakness wiUlin the herd. The reason for Ulis is Ulat the cougar can only INTRODUCTION run at top speed for short distances. Therefore, it is imperative to get as close to its prey as possible before making a killing strike. Otherwise, the opportunity will be lost and it may be some time before the next one ap­ pears. The more days that the cougar goes without food, the slower it will be able to run, thus making it harder and harder to attack its prey. So why are we talkillg about cougars? Playing the market is very much like tlle cougar's hunt for prey. Whether you are trading the Forex market, the Futures market, the Op­ tions market, the Equities market, and so fortll, you must have a pla.n be­ fore entering each trade. If you do not, it will be harder and harder to find opportunities because each lost opportwtity will take a toll mentally, phys­ ically, and psychologically on your well-being. Therefore, you must observe the instrument greatly before executing a trade. In another words, you must become an a.nalyst before a trader. Ir you are a trader before an analyst then you will be "rolling dice" at each opportunity. Just like the cougar obsenres its prey for weaknesses before
