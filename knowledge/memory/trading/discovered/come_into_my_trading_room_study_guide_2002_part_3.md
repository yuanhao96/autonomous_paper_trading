Chapter 5 (pages 80–117). Additional Reading Elder, Alexander. Trading for a Living (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1993). See “Computerized Technical Analysis” (pages 115–166). LeBeau, Charles, and David W. Lucas. Technical Traders Guide to Computer Analysis of the Futures Market (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1991). Murphy, John J. Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1999). F I V E TRADING Answer 40 D. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Give yourself four points for choosing the correct answer (two points if you answered C or E, partly correct). A good trading system pulls out a few key factors from the huge mass of market information. Market-driving factors keep slowly changing, which is why system parameters must be tweaked with the passage of time. Discretionary traders with a good feel for the markets focus their attention on different factors at different times. All beginners are preoccupied with entries, but you get paid for exiting trades. An automatic system, especially if purchased from a vendor, is a gambler’s dream, but trading requires persistent work. Answer 41 C. 1, 2, and 3. Give yourself four points for choosing the correct answer. To be worth trading, a system must provide a positive mathematical expectation of generating more money than it loses over a period of time. The only way to find out is to test the system yourself. Computerized testing may be more objective, but manual testing more closely replicates the experience of trading the markets, with all its psychological stresses. You have to manually test your system to find whether it fits your temperament as well as your wallet. Most parameters of a trading system can be 111 112 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES tweaked, except for a few inviolate rules, including money management rules. Even if a system seems to do better after dropping those rules, you should not expose your account to unlimited risk. Answer 42 C. 1, 2, and 3. Give yourself four points for choosing the correct answer. The main value of paper trading is it allows you to test your discipline and ability to do homework day after day, although most people simply escape into it after losing money. If done right, paper trading takes just as much time as the real thing. The results of paper trading almost always look better than real trading, because there is no emotional pressure from risking money. Answer 43 1. C 2. D 3. A 4. D 5. B Give yourself a point for each correct answer. You cannot argue with the direction or the numerical value of an indicator, which is why their signals are more objective than chart patterns. The three indicator groups almost always give contradictory signals. One of the main challenges in technical analysis is to reconcile those conflicts and profit from them. TRADING 113 Answer 44 D. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Give yourself four points for choosing the correct answer. The contradictions between signals in different timeframes present a challenge, as well as an opportunity. We can filter them against one another, leaving only the best signals. Long-term as well as short-term charts are defined by their relationships to the intermediate timeframe, using the Rule of Five. Short-term charts allow you to get closer to the markets, but it is much more important to begin your analysis by making a strategic decision on long-term charts. Answer 45 Phrase 3 is correct. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. One of the key rules of the Triple Screen is to make your decisions in several timeframes, moving down from the longest to the shortest. If you work with weekly, daily, and intraday charts, then make your strategic decision, either bullish or bearish, on the weekly chart, then tactical on the dailies, and find entry and exit points using intraday charts. Answer 46 Choice 4 is not acceptable. Give yourself three points for choosing the right answer. Buying an upside breakout puts you in the direction of the trend, whereas buying pullbacks provides less expensive entries. These are all acceptable methods, but it is seldom a good idea to put in orders without even knowing what price you will have to pay at the opening tomorrow. 114 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Answer 47 D. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. There are many methods for exiting trades. A longer-term trader will watch the EMA, the resistance, or the channel, whereas the shorter-term trader will focus on the channel or the spikes in Force Index. Use the method that appeals to you, but do not make your decisions “on the gut.” If you sell on the gut today, you will be tempted to buy on the gut tomorrow, and that’s where the real trouble will start. Rating Yourself Below 24 Poor. You need to give yourself a little more time to learn about trading before putting money on the line. Testing systems and indicators, while combining different timeframes, is a key concept of successful trading. Please return to the recommended reading materials, study them, and retake this test a few days later before proceeding to the rest of the Study Guide. 24–28 Fairly good. You understand the key concepts of trading. Still, it would make sense to read up on the questions that you have missed. This topic is too important to leave out a few blanks. 29–32 Excellent. You understand the key trading ideas. If you are interested in day-trading, please proceed to the next chapter; otherwise, skip it and go directly to Advanced Concepts,
