Chapter 2 by Kenji Oyama, published by Nihon Keisai Shimbunsha Shinpan Jissen Kabushiki Chart Nyumon (Introduction to Stock Charts) by Okasan Keisai Kenkyusho, published by Diamond-sha Sakata Goho Wa Furinkazan (Sakata's Five Rules are Wind, Forest, Fire and Mountain), published by Nihon Shoken Shimbunsha Yoshimi Toshihiko no Chato Kyoshitsu (Toshihiko Yoshimi's Chart Classroom) by Toshihiko Yoshimi, published by Nihon Chart Then there's the team at Merrill Lynch who were so helpful in looking over the manuscript, making suggestions, and providing ideas. John Gambino, one of the best colleagues anyone can work with provided all the Elliott Wave counts in this book. Chris Stewart, Manager of Futures Research, not only read the entire manuscript but provided valuable suggestions and finely dissected the many, many charts I used. I also want to thank Jack Kavanagh in compliance who also read the manuscript. Yuko Song provided extra insights by conveying some of my candlestick questions to her Japanese customers who use candlesticks. I have included hundreds of charts in this book from various services. Before I thank all the services that have generously provided use of their candlestick charts, I want to give plaudits to Bloomberg L.P. and CQG (Commodity Quote Graphics). Bloomberg L.P. was among the first on-line services to provide candlestick charts on the American markets. It's too bad I didn't discover this earlier. I was drawing candlestick charts on my own for years before I found out about Bloomberg. CQG, an on-line futures charting service, was also among the first to see the potential of candlestick charts. Within a few weeks of my first candlestick article, they sent me an alpha test (this is a high-tech term for the very early stages of software prototype testing) of their candlestick software for my CQG System One T". Once I had this software, my candlestick research progressed exponentially. Most of the charts in this book are courtesy of CQG. Besides Bloomberg L.P. and CQG, other services that were kind enough to provide charts are: T Commodity Trend Service Charts (North Palm Beach, FL), CompuTrac " (New Orleans, LA), Ensign Software (Idaho Falls, ID), FutureSource " (Lombard, Ill), and Quick 10-E Financial Information System (New York, N.Y.). T I want to thank those who took time from their busy schedules to review the introductions for Part Two of the book. These are: Dan -- - Acknowledgements Gramza for the chapter on Market Profile@;Jeff Korzenik for the chapters on options and hedging; John Murphy for the chapter on volume and open interest; once again, John Gambino for the chapter on Elliott Wave; Charles LeBeau for the chapter on oscillators; Gerard Sanfilippo and Judy Ganes for the chapter on hedging; and Bruce Kamich for the English language glossary. The Nippon Technical Analysts Association (NTAA) deserves utmost praise for their assistance. Mr. Kojiiro Watanabe at the Tokyo Investment Information Center helped me to contact NTAA members who have been especially helpful. They are: Mr. Minoru Eda, Manager, Quantative Research, Kokusai Securities Co.; Mr. Yasushi Hayashi, Senior Foreign Exchange Trader at Sumitomo Life Insurance; and Mr. Nori Hayashi, Senior Analyst, Fidelity Management and Research (Far East). When I asked them questions via fax I expected just brief answers. But these three NTAA members took their valuable time to write pages of explanations, complete with drawings. They were wonderful about sharing their candlestick experiences and insights with me. I also want to thank them for reading over and providing information for
