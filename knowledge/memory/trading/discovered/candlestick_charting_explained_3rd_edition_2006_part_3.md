Chapter 10. Gregory L. Morris Big Canoe, GA 2006 Acknowledgments There are people without whom this book could not have been possible. Where do I start? Who do I mention first? This, quite possibly, is more difficult than the book itself. One must never forget one’s roots. There is no doubt in my mind that my parents, Dwight and Mary Morris, are mostly responsible for all the good that I have ever accomplished. Any of the bad surely had to come from being a jet fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy for six years. I am blessed with a wonderful wife, Laura. Her support during this effort was unwavering and fully appreciated. Norman North (Mr. N-Squared Computing) has gone from a business associate to a valued friend. His insight and opinions are always sought and usually relied upon. The bottom line is this: without Norm, this book would not have been written. Steve North (Norm’s son) was invaluable with all the new material that was used in this edition. I am forever grateful to Takehiro Hikita for his gracious offer to visit Japan, stay in his home, and help with the many Japanese interpretations. My trip to Japan in January 1992 to study Japanese candlestick analysis was invaluable. His knowledge of candle pattern analysis is filtered throughout this book. Ron Salter, of Salter Asset Management, has always offered an unusual but insightful opinion on the economy and the markets, one that usually seems to be more right than wrong. I am grateful for his permission to quote some of his comments from his client letter. 䊏 xxiii 䊏 䊏 xxiv Acknowledgments Steve Nison must be given full credit and acknowledgment for pioneering “candlesticks” into Western analysis. His book Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques, published by New York Institute of Finance/Simon & Schuster is a classic and provides the reader with a rich history of candlesticks and candlestick analysis. Nison coined many of the English names for the various patterns used in the West today. Many of the concepts used in the West today originated from Nison’s work and have been widely accepted as commonplace among candlestick enthusiasts. This book does not try to change that. The first book translated into English about Japanese candlesticks was The Japanese Chart of Charts, by Seike Shimizu. This book provided as immense wealth of information about all of the popular candle patterns along with their many interpretations. It was translated by Greg Nicholson. Another valuable source of information on candlesticks was published by Nippon Technical Analysis Association, called Analysis of Stock Price in Japan, 1988. My thanks also go to Chip Anderson and all the folks at StockCharts.com for their assistance in creating most of the new charts in this edition. Special recognition goes to Kellie Erlandson for converting them into a usable format and never complaining when I wanted to change something. Also thanks to Edgar Isidro for typing the original book into Microsoft Word. I think I must have been using a DOS-based word processor, or something long since gone when I did the first edition in 1991. Thanks to Jason Holcombe for reviewing all of my Japanese language books in search of any new patterns and providing a few of the translations for the new patterns. Thanks to Raymond Fowkes for his expertise in generating the Microsoft Excel tables that were converted into the Pattern Detail Information Boxes in Chapters 3 and 4. xxv 䊏 Acknowledgments I need to give special mention of Ryan Litchfield, who made some significant contributions to this new edition. Ryan has a unique way of viewing markets and trading, and our collaboration on this edition has enhanced this book significantly. You are going to enjoy
