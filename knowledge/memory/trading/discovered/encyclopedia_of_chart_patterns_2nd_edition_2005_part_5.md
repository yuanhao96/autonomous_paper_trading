Chapter 61. If nothing exciting happens that day or the next, then the market is ignoring the result or is not excited enough to move the stock. However, if price drops, sometimes gapping down, or if it drops the next day (if the market was closed during the announcement), then that qualifies as a 3S pattern based on bad news. Figure 60.2 shows another example of the 3S pattern. From the quarterly sales report in March 2000 (not shown), the retailer was doing well peddling camcorders, satellite systems, and televisions. The following quarter, ending in June, the company said sales of digital products were still strong, but why was the stock declining? Was this a case of the fundamentals chasing the technicals? In September, the company reported that sales were sluggish but in line with consensus estimates. The stock gapped down 14% on the news but within about a week, it was trading at the same price, completing a pullback. Whew! A close call, some thought. Not if you owned the stock. Pullbacks and throwbacks are the last chance to get out of or into a trade, respectively. The figure shows what happened. From the close at 47.33 the day before the announcement, the stock dropped to 14, a decline of 70%. Notice the September support set up by the apex of the symmetrical triangle. 4366_60.qxd 2/23/05 12:27 PM Page 911 Identification Guidelines 911 Best Buy Co.

How do you identify a 3S pattern? Table 60.1 lists the characteristics I used. Announcement. Many retailers announce their sales numbers either monthly or quarterly. I read about the numbers in the financial press or hear about it on the nightly television news broadcast. The Internet is also a good source for 3S news. Large price decline. The numbers may appear acceptable, but it is the perception of the market that is important. A same-store sales decline is never good, but if the market expected worse, look for the stock price to rise. However, if same-store sales were supposed to be 5% and they came in at 3%, that may well send the stock plunging. Expect the unexpected. Table 60.1 Identification Characteristics Characteristic Discussion Announcement The company announces monthly or quarterly same-store sales numbers. Large price decline Price gaps downward or makes a large down move that day or the next. The daily trading range must be at least as large as the monthly average or it must gap lower. Downward breakout A breakout occurs when price closes below the intraday low posted on the day of the announcement. Volume Usually heavy. 4366_60.qxd 2/23/05 912 12:27 PM Page 912 Same-Store Sales, Bad I computed the average trading range for the prior month and compared that to the range on the day of, or the day after, the announcement. If the intraday range was wider than the average, then I included the pattern in the study. I also included patterns that gapped downward on the announcement day, regardless of their intraday trading range. For identification, look for a large price decline the day the announcement comes or the next day (in case of closed markets or if word is slow to disperse). Sometimes, a price gap occurs like that shown in Figures 60.1 and 60.2. I looked for gaps and large price moves but ignored everything else including decreasing same-store sales numbers. Gaps and large price moves mean a more promising (better performing) trade. Downward breakout. What is a breakout? It is a close below the intraday low posted on the day of the announcement. Even if the stock gaps downward, I ignored it if the breakout was upward. Volume. Expect heavy volume, volume that is above the average posted over the prior month. Focus on Failures What can go wrong with the 3S pattern? Figure 60.3 shows the first example of a poor performer. At the time, the company was named Consolidated Stores Big Lots, Inc.

Price quickly recovers and makes new highs. 4366_60.qxd 2/23/05 12:27 PM Page 913 Statistics 913 and it reported same-store sales as those open for at least 2 years. In mid-July, the company said total sales for June were up a whopping 69%, but same-store sales were up just 3.4%. In the prior 8 weeks, sales were up 2.6% and year-todate, up 3.9%. What happened to the stock? It made a large down move that day and the next, pulled back to where it was trading before the announcement, and then formed an ascending scallop. Notice how price stops declining at the top of the March gap. Coincidence? Perhaps, but gaps set up support and resistance zones. Statistics Table 60.2 shows general statistics for the 3S pattern based on bad same-store sales. Number of formations. I looked at all the retailers in my database of 500+ stocks and found only 28 with 3S patterns starting from early 1995. As you might guess, my data is limited and so are the samples. I found 258 valid patterns in bull markets, but just 78 in bear markets. Remember, these patterns all have intraday price ranges that are wider than the 1-month average. If I allowed all 3S patterns in, the performance would be worse, but I would have substantially more samples. Reversal or continuation. Most of the 3S patterns I looked at acted as consolidations or continuations of the prevailing price trend. That finding means price dropped into the pattern and broke out downward. Reversals performed marginally better than continuations. Average decline. The average decline, measured from the low price on the day of the announcement to the ultimate low, was 12% and 14% for bull and bear markets, respectively. If you u
