Chapter 1, I distinguish between humdrum and historical change but I understate the importance of the distinction. I call it "tautological." I now consider this a mistake. The tautology arises only because I do not probe deeply enough and cover up with a tautology what is a fundamental difference in the structure of events. In most phenomena investigated by scientific method, one set of conditions follows another irrespective of what anybody thinks about them. The phenomena studied by social sciences, which , , Preface 7 include the finan~ial~markets, have thinking participants and this complicates matters. As I have tried to show, the participants' views are inherently biased. Instead of a direct line leading from one set of conditions to the n e ~ tone, there is a constant criss-crossing between the objective, abservable conditions and the participant's observations and vice &sa: participants base their decisions not on objective conditions but on their interpretation of those conditions. This is an important point and it has far-reaching consequences. It introduces an element of indeterminacy which renders the subject matter less amenable to the kind of generalizations, predictions, and explanations that have given natural science its reputation. Exactly because it is so disruptive; the social sciztnces in general and economic theory in particular have done their best to eliminate or to ignore the element of indeterminacy. I have taken issue with that endeavor and tried to develop an alternative approach which takes the participants' bias:as its starting point. In retrospect, I may have overstated my case. There are many situations that can be fruitfully studied by taking the participants' bias as given and ignoring the element of indeterminacy which it may generate. It is only in certain respects and in certain special circumstances that the indeterminacy becomes significant. It comes into play when expectations about the future have a bearing on present behavior-which is the case in financial markets. But even there, some mechanism must be triggered for the participants' bias to affect not only market prices but the so-called fundamentals which are supposed to determine market prices. Apparently 1have sufficiently clear. The message of my boo failed tokake this is usually summed up by saying that the participants' value judgments are always biased and the prevailing bias aifects narket prices. If that is all I had to say it would be hardly worth writing a book about it. My point is that there are occasions when the bias affects not only market prices but also the so-called fundamentals. This is when reflexivity becomes important. It does not happen all the time but when it does, market prices follow a different pattern. They also play a different role: they do not merely reflect the so-called fundamentals; they themselves become one of the fundamentals which shape the evolution of prices. This recursive relationship renders the evolution of prices indeterminate and the so-called equilibrium price irrelevant. Nobody would deny that individual participants operate with biased views; but the prevailing wisdom holds that the participants' 8 -w- 4 Preface bias can be dismissed as temporary aberrations, so-called random walks. That is the point on which I disagree. I now believe this point can be more effectively made by drawing a distinction between near-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium conditions than by proposing a general theory of history based on the constant cross-crossing between perceptions and reality as I have done in The Alchemy of Finance. That does not mean that there is anything wrong with the general theory; it means only that the concept of reflexivity becomes more significant if it is reserved for those cases where the double feedback mechanism is actually at work. The Alchemy of Finance is devoted to the study of such cases. The a s s t c??vious exam.ple is equity lewragirtg where a temporary overvaluation of shares is converted into per-share earnings through the issue of shares at inflated prices. In most of the cases discussed, the participants' bias involves an actual error in their thinking. For instance, in the late 1970s international bankers lent too much money to developing countries because they failed to recognize that the so-called debt ratios they used to measure the creditworthiness of the borrowing countries were reflexive in the sense that they were affected by their own lending activity. But it is not necessary for the bias to involve an actual error. As I show in
