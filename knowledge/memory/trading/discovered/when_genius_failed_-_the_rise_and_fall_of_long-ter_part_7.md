Until the mid-\17796os, bond trading had been a dull sport. An investor bought bonds, often from the trust department of his local bank, for steady income,and as long as the bonds didn't default, he was generally happy with his purchase, if indeed he gave it any further thought.

If bondholders still harbored any illusion of stability, the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad, which was widely owned by blue-chip accounts, wreckedthe illusion forever. Bond investors, most of them knee-deep in losses, were no longer comfortable standing pat.
