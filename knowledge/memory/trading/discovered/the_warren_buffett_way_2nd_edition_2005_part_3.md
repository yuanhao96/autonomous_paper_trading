Chapter 4). One reason Buffett and Munger fit so well is that both men possess an uncompromising attitude toward commonsense business principles. Like Buffett, who endured poor returns in the insurance industry and for a time refused to write policies, Charlie, in his function as CEO of Wesco, refused to make loans when confronted with an unruly savings and loan industry. Both exhibit managerial qualities necessary to run high-quality businesses. Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders are blessed in having managing partners who look after their interest and help them make money in all economic environments. With Buffett’s policy on mandatory retirement—he does not believe in it—Berkshire’s shareholders will continue to benefit not from one mind but two long into the future. A BLENDING OF INFLUENCES Shortly after Graham’s death in 1976, Buffett became the designated steward of Graham’s value approach to investing. Indeed, Buffett’s name became synonymous with value investing. It is easy to see why. He was the most famous of Graham’s dedicated students, and Buffett never missed an opportunity to acknowledge the intellectual debt he owed to Graham. Even today, Buffett considers Graham to be the one individual, after his father, who had the most inf luence on his investment life.17 How, then, does Buffett reconcile his intellectual indebtedness to Graham with stock purchases like the Washington Post Company (1973) and the Coca-Cola Company (1988)? Neither passed Graham’s strict financial test for purchase, yet Buffett made significant investments in both. As early as 1965, Buffett was becoming aware that Graham’s strategy of buying cheap stocks was not ideal.18 Following his mentor’s approach The Education of Warren Buffett 25 of searching for companies that were selling for less than their net working capital, Buffett bought some genuine losers. Several companies that he had bought at a cheap price (hence they met Graham’s test for purchase) were cheap because their underlying businesses were suffering. From his earliest investment mistakes, Buffett began moving away from Graham’s strict teachings. “I evolved,” he admitted, “but I didn’t go from ape to human or human to ape in a nice even manner.”19 He was beginning to appreciate the qualitative nature of certain companies, compared with the quantitative aspects of others. Despite that, however, he still found himself searching for bargains, sometimes with horrible results. “My punishment,” he confessed, “was an education in the economics of short-line farm implementation manufacturers (Dempster Mill Manufacturing), third-place department stores (Hochschild-Kohn), and New England textile manufacturers (Berkshire Hathaway).”20 Buffett’s evolution was delayed, he admitted, because what Graham taught him was so valuable. When evaluating stocks, Graham did not think about the specifics of the businesses. Nor did he ponder the capabilities of management. He limited his research investigation to corporate filings and annual reports. If there was a mathematical probability of making money because the share price was less than the assets of the company, Graham purchased the company, regardless of its business or its management. To increase the probability of success, he purchased as many of these statistical equations as possible. If Graham’s teachings were limited to these precepts, Buffett would have had little regard for him. But the margin-of-safety theory that Graham emphasized was so important to Buffett that he could overlook all other current weaknesses of Graham’s methodology. Even today, Buffett continues to embrace Graham’s primary idea, the theory of margin of safety. “Forty-two years after reading that,” Buffett noted, “I still think those are the three right words.”21 The key lesson that Buffett took from Graham was that successful investing involved purchasing stocks when their market price was at a significant discount to the underlying business value. In addition to the margin-of-safety theory, which became the intellectual framework of Buffett’s thinking, Graham helped Buffett appreciate the folly of following stock market f luctuations. Stocks have an investment characteristic and a speculative characteristic, Graham 26 T H E W A R R E N B U F F E T T W AY taught, and the speculative characteristics are a consequence of people’s fear and greed. These emotions, present in most investors, cause stock prices to gyrate far above and, more important, far below a company’s intrinsic value, thus presenting a margin of safety. Graham taught Buffett that if he could insulate himself from the emotional whirlwinds of the stock market, he had an opportunity to exploit the irrational behavior of other investors, who purchased stocks based on emotion, not logic. From Graham, Buffett learned how to think independently. If he reached a logical conclusion based on sound judgment, Graham counseled Buffett, he should not be dissuaded just because others disagree. “You are neither right or wrong because the crowd disagrees with you,” he wrote. “You are right because your data and reasoning are right.”22 Phil Fisher in many ways was the exact opposite of Ben Graham. Fisher believed that to make sound decisions, investors needed to become fully informed about a business. That meant they needed to investigate all aspects of the company. They needed to look beyond the numbers and learn about the business itself because that information mattered a great deal. They also needed to study the attributes of the company’s management, for management’s abilities could affect the value of the underlying business. They should learn as much as they could about the industry in which the company operated, and about its competitors. Every source of information should be exploited. Appearing on the PBS show Money World in 1993, Buffett was asked what investment advice he would give a money manager just starting out. “I’d tell him to do exactly what I did 40-odd years ago, w
