Chapter 3. They are useful in gauging market sentiment and can provide valuable information when used in conjunction with volume. We would want to be in the trade with a pair of bullish candlesticks. The bullishness or bearishness of candlestick patterns should not be determined on the basis of a single candlestick. Group patterns are formed by clusters of price bars over a given time period. There are two types of patterns. The linear patterns can be distinguished as bearish reversals (top reversal patterns) or bullish reversals (bottom reversal patterns), or continuation patterns. (See Figure 2.1 .) They include head and shoulders (tops and bottoms), double bottoms and double tops, rectangle or line formations, diagonal patterns, and triangles. The rounding patterns are the bullish and bearish saucer patterns, or rounding tops and rounding bottoms. Patterns do not give outright buy/sell signals. They indicate market situations and serve as setup conditions for a probable change in trend. The patterns described in this book appear very frequently in stock trends and should be more than adequate to detect such probable changes of trend direction. A change in trend to the upside should have the support of a bullish reversal pattern, and a change in trend to the downside should have the pressure of a bearish reversal pattern. During a period where prices are under accumulation or distribution phases, movements of prices are contained within a short trading band like a rectangle pattern. Breakouts from these patterns, supported by volume and candlestick patterns, would signal the start of the relative trend. An important point to keep in mind is that traders should not try to be too critical when determining the formation of patterns by trying to exactly connect the highs or lows of each pivot. Patterns do not need to be an exact fit. FIGURE 2.1 Chart showing bullish and bearish patterns. All markets will trend up when the better-informed buyers have completed their accumulation and will trend down when they have completed their distribution to the uninformed buyers, who are generally the public participants. One of the key factors that differentiates between informed investors and uninformed investors is the access to information. Better-informed investors have earlier access to information whereas uninformed investors do not have the means to gather such information. The trading activities between the informed and uninformed investors will cause a series of reactions that tend to have repetitive patterns and cycles. Elliot Wave Theory is based on the premise of such reactions or overreactions of the collective behavior and emotion of investors. Elliott Wave Theory has been around for decades, but there seems to be no consensus among users as to how wave pattern analysis should be applied for maximum benefit. One reason is the old habit of zealous practitioners trying too hard to pinpoint evolving price patterns by crossing every t and dotting every i. The objective is not to label every turn all the time, which can make analysis of patterns overly complicated. The aim of Elliott Wave Theory is to identify the stage of the market and the specific setup of patterns to determine the trend and its probable future direction. Briefly, the patterns of market prices are always in the process of formation, unfolding in a set structure of five waves in the direction of one larger trend and in a set structure of three waves when moving against that trend. The three-wave structure will correct the movement of the five-wave structure. A five-wave structure is normally labeled as 1-2-3-4-5 and a three-wave structure is labeled as A-B-C. In short, one full Elliott Wave cycle consists of five waves and three waves. It is easier to grasp the theory if we think in terms of a set of two root patterns—impulse waves and corrective waves. Impulse waves are those price movements that are rising in an uptrend or declining in a downtrend. Corrective waves are those that are declining counter to a rising trend, or rising counter to a falling trend. In an impulse pattern, there are two countertrend waves, Wave 2 and Wave 4. In a correction pattern, there is one countertrend wave, Wave B. Elliott Wave Theory is a multifractal system in which each cycle can be part of another cycle or form part of an expanded cycle. In its raw form, Elliott Wave Theory is about forecasting price trends based on chart pattern recognition, and serves as a complement to other technical analysis tools. That is, it is best to buy when the market is in an impulse cycle, and to sell when it is in a correction cycle. Chart patterns delineate the imbalances of supply and demand; they are important because they inform traders of the status of the market at any given time and help to determine the likely direction of the trend. VOLUME Volume is an important component of analyzing directional price movements. Its importance is often overlooked by traders because it is such a simple indicator. Volume is often the precursor of price trend. But volume by itself is not a signal for entry or exit of trades, and a single volume bar will not be meaningful if it is not compared with its recent historical patterns. During an uptrend, volume will rise with rising prices and fall during a correction. Volume can also serve as a tool for guiding wave counts and in projecting extensions of waves. For example, in a fifth wave, volume generally tends to be less than that of the third wave. If volume is greater than that of the third wave, an extension of the fifth wave is more likely. In any bull market, volume tends to expand and contract with the momentum of price change. Toward the end of a corrective phase, a decline in volume often indicates a decline in selling pressure and a low point in volume often coincides with a turning point in the market. The discrepancy between volume and price spread is another indication to watch for price reversal. (See Figure
