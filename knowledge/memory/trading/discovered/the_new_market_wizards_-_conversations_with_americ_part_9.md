PART IV Fund Managers and Timers 74 75 Stanley Druckenmiller: The Art of Top-Down Investing Stanley Druckenmiller belongs to the rarefied world of managers who control multibillion-dollar portfolios. Achieving a near 40 percent return on a $100 million portfolio is impressive, but realizing that performance level on a multibillion-dollar fund is incredible. In the three years since he assumed active management control of the Quantum Fund from his mentor and idol, George Soros, Druckenmiller has realized an average annual return of over 38 percent on assets ranging between $2.0 billion and $3.5 billion. Druckenmiller has been on a fast track ever since he decided to forsake graduate school for the real world. After less than one year as a stock analyst for the Pittsburgh National Bank, Druckenmiller was promoted to the position of director of equity research. Druckenmiller dismisses his sudden promotion as the act of an eccentric, albeit brilliant, division manager. However, one suspects there was more to it, particularly in light of Druckenmiller's subsequent achievements. Less than one year later, when the division head who had hired Druckenmiller left the bank, Druckenmiller was promoted to assume his slot, once again leapfrogging a host of senior managers maneuvering for the same position. Two years later, in 1980, at the young age of twentyeight, Druckenmiller left the bank to launch his own money management firm, Duquesne Capital Management. In 1986, Druckenmiller was recruited by Dreyfus as a fund manager. As part of the agreement, Dreyfus permitted Druckenmiller to continue managing his own Duquesne Fund. By the time Drucken-miller joined Dreyfus, his management style had been transformed from a conventional approach of holding a portfolio of stocks into an eclectic strategy incorporating bonds, currencies, and stocks, with the flexibility of trading any of these markets from both the short side and the long side. Dreyfus was so enamored with Druckenmiller's innate market approach that the company developed a few funds around him, the most popular being the Strategic Aggressive Investing Fund, which was the best-performing fund in the industry from its date of inception (March 1987) until Druckenmiller left Dreyfus in August 1988. Druckenmiller's popularity at Dreyfus proved to be too much of a good thing. Eventually, he found himself managing seven funds at Dreyfus, in addition to his own Duquesne Fund. The strain of all this activity and his desire to work with Soros, who Druckenmiller considers the greatest investor of our time, prompted him to leave Dreyfus for Soros Management. Shortly thereafter, Soros turned over the management of his fund to Druckenmiller, as Soros left to pursue his goal of helping to transform the closed economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The longest-running measure of Druckenmiller's performance in the markets is his own Duquesne fund. Since its inception in 1980, the fund has averaged 37 percent annually. Druckenmiller stresses that the early years of Duquesne's performance are not directly relevant since the fund's structure changed completely in mid-1986 to accommodate the flexible trading approach he now uses. Measured from this later starting point, Druckenmiller's average annual return has been 45 percent. I interviewed Druckenmiller at his co-op apartment on a weekend day. I was surprised by his youth; I had hardly expected someone who had been managing one of the world's largest funds for several years to still be in his thirties. As we relaxed in the living room, our conversation began with Druckenmiller's story of how he got started in the business. I had enrolled in graduate school to study for an economics degree. However, I found the program overly quantitative and theoretical, with little emphasis on real-life applications. I was very disappointed and dropped out in the second semester. I took a job as a management trainee at the Pittsburgh National Bank, with the idea that the program would provide me with a broad overview that would help me to decide on an area of focus. I had been at the bank for several months when I received a call from the manager in the trust department. "I hear you attended the University of Michigan," he said. When I confirmed his statement, he said, "Great." He asked whether I had an M.B.A. I told him that I did not. He said, "That's even better. Come on up; you're hired." ==== What job did he give you? ==== I was hired as a bank and chemical stock analyst. ==== Was that the type of position you perceived yourself heading toward? ==== I really had no idea what kind of job I would end up with. Most of the people who entered the management training program at the bank had an immediate goal of becoming a loan officer. I thought that I had been doing pretty well when the head of the loan department informed me that I would make a terrible loan officer. He said that I was too interested in the actual functioning of the companies, whereas a loan officer's job was essentially a sales position. He thought my personality was too abrupt and generally unsuitable for sales. I remember feeling quite let down by being told that I was going to be a failure, when all along I had thought that I was doing quite well in the program. ==== Tell me about your early experiences as a stock analyst. ==== The director of investments was Speros Drelles, the person who had hired me. He was brilliant, with a great aptitude for teaching, but he was also quite eccentric. When I was twenty-five and had been in the department for only about a year, he summoned me into his office and announced that he was going to make me the director of equity research- This was quite a bizarre move, since my boss was about fifty years old and had been with the bank for over twenty-five years. Moreover, all the other analysts had M.B.A.'s and had been in the department longer than I had. "You know why I'm doing this, don't you?" he asked. 7
