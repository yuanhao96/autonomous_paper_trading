Carney is President and Founder of HarmonicTrader.com, and the originator of the Harmonic Trading approach. He personally defined this unprecedented methodology that employs a unique system of price pattern recognition and Fibonacci measurement techniques to define opportunities in the financial markets. Among his many discoveries, Scott has defined most of the harmonic patterns, including the Bat, the ideal Gartley, and the Crab. He has been recognized for other contributions to Technical Analysis, including the concept of the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ), the 0.886 retracement, and the 38.2% trailer. Carney has been a columnist for StockCharts.com, TradingMarkets.com, and eSignal.com, and he has been featured on CNN. He is a full member of the Market Technicians Association (www.mta.org) and the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts (www.aapta.us).

The basic tenets of pattern recognition as quantified by harmonic ratios define a system that provides immensely pertinent technical information and identifies trading opportunities unlike any other methodology.

The new measurement techniques presented in this book quantified price action in a unique manner. These new ideas created the framework of an unprecedented Fibonacci measurement and price pattern recognition system that consistently defined profitable trading opportunities. Although it was not my intention to formulate such a system, these strategies were the result of extensive research to discover the most effective relationships that were encompassed by these measurement tools. Through it all, I precisely refined many general concepts and publicly divulged many “secret” strategies that comprised the fundamentals of the Harmonic Trading approach. The unprecedented combinations of specific ratios that differentiated similar price structures as exact patterns defined an effective trading methodology, yielding relevant technical information in an unprecedented fashion. Although others years before me have utilized Fibonacci ratios within the realm of Technical Analysis, the concept of exact ratio alignments presented a new means to define M-type and W-type price structures. These precise patterns offered greater accuracy in the often vague discipline of pattern recognition for many traders. Although the rules that define harmonic patterns seem t
