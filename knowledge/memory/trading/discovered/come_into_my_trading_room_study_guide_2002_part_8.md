Chapter 7 ”Money Management Formulas.” Additional Reading Vince, Ralph. Portfolio Management Formulas (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1990). N I N E THE ORGANIZED TRADER Answer 83 Factor 3 is correct. Give yourself three points for choosing the right answer. All factors listed here are important, but none more so than discipline. Markets are full of intelligent people with experience and imagination who have been trained and still fail to make money. Discipline is the key factor; without it all others are useless. Answer 84 Choice 2. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. Good records are the key factor in disciplined trading. Keeping them leads to a reduction in trading mistakes. No matter how good your records, no matter how proficient you become in trading, nothing permits you to relax your money management discipline; if anything, as traders get better, they tend to tighten their money management. Answer 85 E. All of the above. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. Entry and exit dates and price levels are the basic starting points for this spreadsheet. It also helps to keep an eye on expenses. A more 133 134 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES sophisticated trader uses his spreadsheet to calculate his performance grade for every trade, that is, the percentage of a trading channel caught in that trade. He can also rate the quality of entries and exits—whether he bought or sold closer to the top or the bottom of the daily bar. Answer 86 C. 1, 2, and 3. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. If you intend to treat trading as a business, you must know its cash position at any given time. Equity in a trading account consists of the current value of all open positions, marking open profits and losses to market, as well as cash and cash equivalents, such as T-bills. Funds outside of your trading account, such as savings or credit lines, are immaterial to your equity. Answer 87 Trader 5 has the best equity curve. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. Trader 4 earned the biggest profit, but his drawdown is outright scary. A $28,000 drawdown represents more than a quarter of this trader’s starting equity. What if such a deep drawdown comes at the very beginning of a money management period? No matter how brilliant a comeback, this kind of trading is an invitation to disaster. Most fund managers look for steady gains with small drawdowns. If your drawdown never goes into double digits, your performance is brilliant. Answer 88 Choice 4 is correct. Give yourself three points for choosing the right answer. One chart per entry or exit may not be enough, because entries and exits tend to be complex affairs with several parameters. You may want to print out a weekly, a daily and an intraday chart for an entry and a THE ORGANIZED TRADER 135 daily, and an intraday for an exit. Five charts per entry or exit is too much; trading decisions are best reduced to a small number of key parameters. Answer 89 C. 1, 2, and 3. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer (two points if you chose D). Gloating after taking a profit or cringing after taking a loss does nothing to improve future performance. What did I do right? Have I made a mistake? What should I do differently next time? A focused, disciplined trader keeps asking himself these and other questions, and a trading diary helps him answer them. People who have the discipline to keep good records have the discipline to win consistently. Still, it may be impractical for a very active trader to keep a diary of every single trade. In that case, it is important to keep a diary for every second, third, or fifth trade, in strict order, rather than deciding to keep it for “interesting” trades and omitting it for “ordinary” trades. Knowing which is which tends to come well after a trade has been closed out. Answer 90 Entry—4. 75%. Exit— 2. 25%. Give yourself two points for each correct answer. The entry grade rates the quality of your entry by expressing it as a percentage of that day’s range. If the high of the day was 48, the low 44, and you bought at 47, then your entry grade is 75, meaning you missed 75% of the day’s range. The lower the percentage while buying, the better. The exit grade rates the quality of your exit. If the high of the day was 54, the low 50, and you sold at 51, your exit grade is 25. It means you captured 25% of that day’s range. The higher the percentage, the better for the seller. The idea is to get your buying grade below 50% and 136 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES your selling grade above 50%. This is much harder to accomplish than it looks. Answer 91 C. 1, 2, and 3. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer (two points if you chose B). Rapidly changing prices affect people like the noise and flashing of slot machines, tempting them to put in another quarter. Making decisions to buy, sell, or stand aside when the markets are closed offers traders the luxury of time. Comparing your stock or future to others adds an extra dimension to your decision-making process. It is a bad idea to ask for advice on specific trades before taking them—those trades are yours and the decision is yours alone. Answer 92 1. A 2. B 3. C 4. E 5. D Give yourself a point for each correct answer. Having to describe a chart forces you to focus on specific signals that led to a trading decision. Live charts often seduce traders into joining emotional crowds; reading your orders from a printed sheet reinforces discipline. If you planned to buy a stock if it trades flat, but it gaps up the next morning and you have not planned for it, there is no reason to trade. When a stock does something you have not anticipated, that is a clear signal that your decision making was not in gear with the market, and putting on a trade is not a good idea.
