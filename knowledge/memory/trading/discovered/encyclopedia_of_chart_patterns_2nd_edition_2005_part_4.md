Chapter 54. Wait for the bounce and then sell as price rounds over at the top just before a renewed decline. Usually the decline from this pattern is not severe (see Table 56.3 to see how many patterns fail to drop far). If you can stomach the loss, then hang in there, especially if it is a bull market and price is trending upward. However, sometimes the pattern acts as a reversal of the uptrend. Sell immediately or wait for a correctly positioned stop loss to take you out of an existing position. Remember, changes that affect earnings usually take longer than a quarter to fix, so if the company disappointed this quarter, there is a good chance it will do so again next quarter. I verified this prediction by looking at 1,963 earnings announcements. There were 866 consecutive earnings announcements with upward breakouts and 582 with downward breakouts (the pattern acted as a continuation of the price trend). In 515 additional cases, the breakout direction flipped from down to up or up to down from quarter to quarter (price reversals). Thus, 74% of the earnings announcements (866 + 582 out of 1,963) follow announcements having the same breakout direction. If one quarter is bad, there is a 74% probability that another bad quarter will follow. Sell short signal. Performance from this pattern is poor, so I suggest you look for other event patterns to short. If you have a compelling situation, then review the “For Best Performance” section. The stock should be traded in a bear market and the price trend leading to the announcement should be downward. When price closes below the intraday low posted on the announcement day, then that is the sell short signal. Watch the stock closely as half the patterns bottom in the first week. Lower your stop as the stock declines. Keep an eye on the stock 4 to 5 weeks into the trade as price sometimes rebounds then. 4366_56.qxd 2/23/05 12:28 PM Page 865 Sample Trade 865 Measure rule. How far will price drop? Pretend that a stock has an intraday high of 40 and a low of 38. The measure rule computes the pattern’s height and then applies it to the breakout direction. In this example, the height is 2 (40 – 38) and the target price is 36 (38 – 2). Price reaches the target almost 70% of the time. This figure is below the 80% I like to see, so be conservative in your target estimate. Wait for confirmation. Since the breakout direction is unknown until it happens, wait for price to close below the intraday low posted on the day of the announcement. When that happens, it confirms that you have a valid pattern and it signals a trade. Sample Trade How do you trade a bad earnings surprise? Look at Figure 56.4 for an example. In February, price tops out (point 1) after a sharp rise from the December low. Price moves horizontally for several months, forming a flat support zone (the confirmation line). As is often the case, price climbed to the level of the old high (point 2) and met resistance. The earnings announcement the day after the peak sent price skidding. How low could we expect it to go? On the announcement day, the intraday high was 61.56; the low was 58.75. The measure rule predicted a decline to at least 55.94. Price reached the target just two days after the announcement.

A second downward breakout from an earnings announcement confirms that a bad quarter follows a bad quarter. 4366_56.qxd 2/23/05 866 12:28 PM Page 866 Earnings Surprise, Bad If you shorted this stock, you could expect price to tumble to the confirmation line and stall there. Why? Because on four prior occasions, that is what happened (beginning in February and ending in March). If I saw price begin to rebound near that zone, I would cover my short. Instead of stalling at the confirmation line, price confirmed the double top by closing below the line. The measure rule for the Adam & Eve double top suggested a decline to 40.38, which is the height of the double top subtracted from the price level of the confirmation line. The mid-January price gap was another support zone. Since price plunged through the confirmation line, I would expect support at the January zone. For a week, that is what happened. Price returned to the confirmation line in a 1-day pullback and then struggled lower on declining volume. When do you cover the short? I would be worried that price was climbing again after the small island on high volume in late May. The volume spike suggests renewed interest in the stock. I would have covered there. As you can see, price fell short of the double top measure rule prediction (40.38) by dropping to a low of only 43.13. Notice the second earnings announcement (in July) that sent price lower. Remember that a bad quarter usually follows a bad quarter. The three tops (1, 2, and 3) compose a triple top or a broadening formation, right-angled and descending (bottoms A, B, and C ) with a partial rise in August, suggesting a downward breakout. A downward breakout is what happened in early September. For Best Performance The following list includes tips and observations to help you select better performing patterns. Consult the associated table for more information. • Review the identification guidelines for correct selection—Table 56.1. • Look for patterns in a downward price trend—Table 56.1. • The pattern usually acts as a continuation of the prevailing price trend, so trade with the trend—Table 56.2. • Trade this pattern only in a bear market for the largest average decline —Table 56.2. • Failure rates start high and climb. For better performance, look for a wider intraday trading range (2 times or 3 times the range of the 1month average) on the announcement day—Tables 56
