Chapter 1 The Covered-Write Example 1: Rolling the Covered-Write Up Using a Long Call Spread +100 +100 Calls –1 Strike Puts Calls +1 100 105 Strike –1 100 –1 105 Original Position Puts Roll Up In the preceding example, the 100/105 call spread is purchased, closing out the short call position at the 100 strike and establishing a new short call position at the 105 strike. This gives the position 5.00 more points of “room to run” to the upside, but the cost of the strategy is increased by the cost of the call spread. Example 2: Rolling the Covered-Write Up and Out with a Diagonal Call Spread +100 +100 Calls –1 Strike 100 Puts Calls +1 –1 Strike 100 105 105 Original Position Expiration Month 1 Calls Strike 100 –1 Puts 105 Expiration Month n Puts Trade Management In the preceding example, the 100/105 diagonal call spread is purchased, closing out the short call position at 100 strike in the original expiration month and establishing a new short call position at the 105 strike in expiration month n. This gives the position 5.00 more points of “room to run” to the upside, and the cost of the strategy is increased or decreased by the debit or credit, respectively, of the diagonal call spread. • Situation 3: The Underlying Weakens or Moves Lower; More Protection Is Desired The covered-write does offer a modest amount of downside protection for long underlying positions. The amount of this protection is equal to the premium collected when the investor writes the call. If he wants additional protection, additional premiums must be collected. This can be accomplished by “rolling down” the short call to a lower strike by selling a vertical call spread in the same expiration month. Or, it can be accomplished by executing a diagonal call spread known as a down and out—covering the short call and selling a lower strike call in a deferred expiration. Both strategies should generate a credit that will provide further downside protection for the underlying position. Which method is chosen usually depends on the amount of protection wanted and the size of the credit that can be generated. Example 1: Rolling the Covered-Write Down Using a Short Vertical Call Spread +100 +100 Calls Strike Puts Calls –1 95 –1 100 Original Position +1 Strike Puts 95 100 Roll Down In the preceding example, the 95/100 call spread is sold, closing out the short call position at 100 strike and establishing a new short call position at the 95 strike. Depending on the credit generated, this gives additional downside protection to the underlying position. 23 24
