Chapter 10, I look for the highest probability trades. Those are the ones that are supported by fundamentals, technicals, and market sentiment. To be more specific, if USD/JPY is in an uptrend and has retraced to the first standard deviation Bollinger Band, I will only buy the currency pair hoping for a continuation if the U.S. stock market ended the day marginally lower, flat, or higher, which means sentiment does not hurt my trade and if there is a piece of U.S. economic data tomorrow that I think will either be positive or neutral for the trade. If stocks fell significantly or if I have a strong reason to believe the next day’s U.S. economic data will be dollar negative, I will most likely pass on the trade. The Bollinger Band trades are usually held overnight so I will put in my stop along with a first target on half of the position. I will also put a second target for the remainder of the position that is much further away from the first target but still achievable in case there are big moves overnight when I am sleeping. Remember, be smart by considering the exit for the trade early on; it’s just as important as finding a good point of entry. When this is done, I list the economic data due for release tomorrow so I am prepared for the new trading day. However, there is still one more trade to take on this particular day, which is a short-term trade on the heels of the Australian employment report. There is tradable Australian or New Zealand economic data only once or twice a week so normally I can still go the gym and get a good night’s rest before the whole process begins again. Trading plans are different and evolve with time but are useful to develop a consistent regimen. In fact, all traders should strive to have a militarylike discipline with the acumen to know when to take a trade and when to pass on it. Know Your Loss Limit In addition to a trading plan, it is also important to have a contingency plan. All good business owners are passively aware of their loss limit, which is the maximum amount that they are able and willing to lose if their business goes sour. For traders, this means knowing when to stop trading. Sometimes we will have a streak of bad luck that leads to a string a losers, and after a certain point, it may be better to just turn off the screen, walk away from the computer, and take a break from trading for a few days before starting again. A series of losers can lead to irrational trading behaviors that will inevitably lead to greater losses. As John Paulson once said, one of the key investments rules that he lives by is to “watch the downside, the upside will take care of itself.” To become a professional trader, it is important to develop a consistent regimen and to have a trading plan. Not only does it save time and get you into the mind-set of trading but it also reduces the potential impact of emotions. When you question your trade—and you inevitably will—the trading plan is there to remind you why you took the trade in the first place. If those reasons have changed, then closing the trade may be a good idea, but if they have not, then stick with it! In my case, I know exactly what I could potentially trade when I step into the office. This saves me time and allows me to focus on other potential trading setups that require watching the price action more closely. Get It? Got It? Good! To be a pro, you have to approach trading as a business, not a hobby! Don’t rely on luck; preparation is the key to good trading. Emotions can kill profits. Write out your trading plan to give your trades a fighting chance. Always know your loss limits. In the words of John Paulson, “Watch the downside, the upside will take care of itself.” Make the exits just as sharp as entries. Chapter Fourteen Crash, Burn, and Learn Becoming a Better Trader When most people think of basketball, they think of Michael Jordan, one of the best basketball players of all time. In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the twentieth century by the sports network ESPN. Ask almost anyone who follows sports and they will say that when it comes to playing basketball, Jordan is a raging success. Yet the following quote is one of the most memorable things that Michael Jordan has ever said and hands down one of the best sports quotes I’ve heard. I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I’ve been trusted to take the gamewinning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. Every good trader has crashed and burned and wiped out a number of trading accounts before turning a consistent profit, and even then there will be losing streaks, but as Michael Jordan suggested, failure is a critical part of success. No matter how much thought we have put into our trading plan and no matter how well we have analyzed the data and charts, markets can trip us up and stop us out at any given time. The important thing is to learn from our mistakes because as Carl Jung, the father of analytical psychology once said, “Knowledge rests not upon truth alone, but upon error also.” How can we learn from our mistakes? In the last chapter, we learned how to create a trading plan, but the other piece of the puzzle is to keep a trading log. Start a simple Excel spreadsheet with a running tally of your trades, noting the currency pair that you traded, the strategy that you used (if there is one), the time that you entered the trade, the price that you entered at, the stop, your profit or loss, and a column for special notes such as “That was a bad trade! Should have avoided Fed meeting” or “Should have stayed in the trade longer!” These notes to yourself will become extremely useful when you review your trades and find room for improvement. Albert Einstein once said, “We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.” Regardless of whether I am on a winning or losing stre
