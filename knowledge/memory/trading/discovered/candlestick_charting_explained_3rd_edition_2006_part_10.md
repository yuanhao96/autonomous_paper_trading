Chapter 6 deals with this concept at length. There is a normal expectancy to have a bullish pattern or situation prior to a bearish counterpart. That tendency will continue here, except when one counterpart tends to exhibit greater prevalence; then it will be covered first. A number of new patterns are introduced with this edition of this book. Many were created to serve as a complementary pattern to those that only had a bullish or bearish version, but not both. In those cases, the original is always presented first. CHAPTER FORMAT Most of the candle patterns will be explained using a standard format that should ensure easy reference at a later date. Some candle patterns will not be covered as thoroughly as others because of their simplicity or similarity to other patterns. Some patterns are only modified ver- 23 䊏 Reversal Candle Patterns sions of another pattern, and will be noted as such. Because many patterns have a counterpart reflecting the other side of the market, some of the scenarios will contain only one example. Additionally, some repetition may seem to occur. This too is so that later reference will be both easy and thorough. The usual format will be: • Pattern detail information box Pattern Name: Japanese Name: Trend Required: Frequency (MDaysBP): Matching Low + niten zoko/kenuki Yes Confirmation: 590 Frequent Type: R+ No Pattern Statistics from 7275 Common Stocks with over 14.6 Million Days of Data Interval (Days) % Winners: Avg. % Gain: % Losers: Avg. % Loss: Net Profit / Net Loss: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 69 3.63 31 -2.60 1.23 64 4.71 36 -3.42 1.43 62 5.42 38 -3.92 1.55 61 5.98 39 -4.39 1.65 60 6.64 40 -4.75 1.77 59 6.98 41 -5.13 1.79 59 7.37 41 -5.48 1.82 Each pattern (bullish + and bearish −) has an information box. This box contains: ■ Pattern Name: with + for bullish and − for bearish ■ Type: R = reversal, C = Continuation ■ Japanese Name: Romanized name ■ Trend Required: Yes or No ■ Confirmation: Required, Suggested, or No Note on confirmation: This was an attempt to identify candle patterns that universally fell into two categories, one that seemed to never work well, and one that seemed to always work well. Those that never seemed to work well need confirmation (Required). Those that seemed to work well all of the time do not need confirmation 䊏 24 Chapter Three (No). A third category was derived because some of those that were originally in the “worked well” category still had a few statistics that were not good, therefore they were placed in the Suggested category, meaning that confirmation is suggested. It is boldly stated later in this book that all candle patterns should be confirmed with other technical methods. A few good ones are mentioned herein. Frequency (MDaysBP): This is the number of mean (average) days between patterns with a classification of Quite Frequent, Frequent, Average, Rare, and Extremely Rare. Statistics over 7 different days of performance: % Winners, Avg. % Gain, % Losers, Avg. % Loss, and Net Profit/Net Loss per Trade. The components of the Pattern Detail Information are further explained in later chapters. • Commentary ■ Description of pattern(s) ■ Western (traditional) counterpart(s) • Graphic of classic pattern(s) ■ Detailed drawing of the classic pattern (days that can be either black or white are shown with shading) • Rules of recognition ■ Simplistic rules for quick identification ■ Criteria for pattern recognition • Scenarios/psychology behind the pattern ■ Possible trading scenarios that could have developed ■ General discussion of the psychology of each day 25 䊏 Reversal Candle Patterns • Pattern flexibility ■ Situations that change the pattern’s effectiveness ■ Allowable deviations from the classic pattern ■ Information for the numerically oriented and computer programmer • Pattern breakdown ■ Reducing the pattern to a single candle line • Related Patterns ■ Patterns that have similar formations ■ Patterns that are part of this pattern • Examples INDEX OF REVERSAL PATTERNS Pattern Page One-Day Patterns Hammer and Hanging Man Belt Hold 27 32 Two-Day Patterns Engulfing Harami Harami Cross Inverted Hammer and Shooting Star Piercing Line Dark Cloud Cover Doji Star Meeting Lines Homing Pigeon Descending Hawk Matching Low 35 40 45 49 55 58 62 66 70 73 76 䊏 26 Chapter Three Pattern Matching High Kicking One White Soldier One Black Crow Page 79 83 87 91 Three-Day Patterns Morning Star and Evening Star Morning Doji Star and Evening Doji Star Abandoned Baby Tri Star Upside Gap Two Crows Downside Gap Two Rabbits Unique Three River Bottom Unique Three Mountain Top Three White Soldiers Three Black Crows Identical Three Crows Advance Block Descent Block Deliberation Two Crows Two Rabbits Three Inside Up and Three Inside Down Three Outside Up and Three Outside Down Three Stars in the South Three Stars in the North Stick Sandwich Squeeze Alert 94 99 103 107 111 114 118 122 125 128 132 135 138 142 148 151 155 159 163 166 169 176 Four-or-More-Day Patterns Breakaway Concealing Baby Swallow Ladder Bottom Ladder Top After Bottom Gap Up After Top Gap Down Three Gap Downs Three Gap Ups 181 186 189 193 197 200 204 207 27 䊏 Reversal Candle Patterns ONE-DAY PATTERNS HAMMER AND HANGING MAN Pattern Name: Japanese Name: Trend Required: Frequency (MDaysBP): Hammer + kanazuchi/tonkachi Yes Confirmation: 284 Quite Frequent Type: R+ Required Pattern Statistics from 7275 Common Stocks with over 14.6 Million Days of Data Interval (Days) % Winners: Avg. % Gain: % Losers: Avg. % Loss: Net Profit / Net Loss: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 41 3.06 59 -3.25 -0.57 43 3.96 57 -4.05 -0.54 44 4.74 56 -4.66 -0.47 44 5.33 56 -5.17 -0.46 45 5.93 55 -5.70 -0.40 46 6.51 54 -6.15 -0.33 47 6.96 53 -6.52 -0.23 Pattern Name: Japanese Name: Trend Required: Frequency (MDaysBP): Hanging Man kubitsuri Yes Confirmation: 117 Quite Frequent Type: RNo Pattern Statistics from 7275 Common Stocks with over 14.6 Million Days of Data Interval (Days) % Winners: Avg. % Gain: % Losers: Avg. % Loss: Net Profit / Net Loss:
