CHAPTER 1 Be Prepared Trading stocks is 100 percent mental. Trading means the buying and selling of one or multiple stocks to take advantage of price fluctuations, rather than just holding on to the stocks indefinitely. Success as a trader is a difficult achievement; it has never been easy. Added to this, the 2008 financial crisis brought to the market a new age of volatility, as well as new thinking and new approaches in trading. If you do not know what you are doing, trading will now be even harder. Markets consist of a multitude of investors from individuals to institutions, each with their own investment agenda. In aggregate, investors’ emotions of greed, fear, hope, and despair dictate market fluctuations and directional movements. Similarly, the psychological state of a trader may affect his trading results because his emotions influence his decision making. To outperform the market and to succeed in trading, a trader needs to take charge of his emotions. To start off, he requires a patient and confident mind. If a trader is confused about what he is doing, the probable win ratio is zero and he might as well give up trading. The mind is mischievous and it often is the primary cause of failures. The market is always creating noises and if a trader fails to control his inner noises, how can he listen to what the market is trying to tell him? In Figure 1.1 , the Hang Seng Index showed that the market was in an optimistic mood for about 55 months from April 2005 to its exuberant high in October 2007. Fear began to take over in November 2007, and the market finally cracked in January 2008. The financial crisis struck across the globe, creating panic among investors. The collapse of confidence lasted about 13 months until the U.S. government began to announce concerted efforts to calm investors. Hope returned to the market with the announcements of the government’s financial stimulus packages. FIGURE 1.1 Greed, Fear, Hope, and Despair form the four psychological states of the market, swinging sentiment states from optimism to pessimism and repeating it all over again, time after time. After approximately eight months, the buoyancy of the market slowed down and investors seemed to return to an anxious mood. Notice that the volatility of the market, shown by the wide monthly range, was greater toward the end of the greed and fear states of the market. The top window shows that the momentum oscillator stayed in the oversold zone for 12 months during the state of fear. During the optimism state, the momentum oscillator stayed continually above the oversold line and rose steadily to the overbought zone, supported by increasing volume. The market is always dynamic. It is oblivious to your wins or losses. But too many traders blame the market for their failures. They do not consider for a moment that their failures are caused by a lack of preparation and irrational emotions. Whatever the cause, the best solution is just to move on to the next trade with a clear mind and in good spirits. A good trader should not dwell on the past. A trader’s ego is his greatest hindrance to being successful. The best approach is to turn emotion into a positive tool. Whenever any negative emotions stir in him, a trader should take it as a wake-up call. He should not allow such emotion to blur his judgment and derail his trading plan. The most common fault in trading is overthinking—dwelling on the past and not keeping to the trading plan. Besides thinking too much, a trader may believe he is always correct and will refuse to accept the reality of the market. Thus, he should make extra effort to understand more of himself and his emotion, so that he will trade better and feel better. FUNDAMENTAL AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS When a stock price is compared to its intrinsic value, it is termed as “fundamental analysis.” When the stock price is looked at from the angle of supply and demand, it is known as “technical analysis.” Each method of analysis is just as useful and important as the other, and both methods should be used in combination when reading the market and selecting stocks. However, it must be remembered that all analysis serves as a means to estimate the value of stocks. Fundamentals refer to the financial information reported by the listed companies, which is always historical. A fundamental analyst calculates the stock’s future worth based on the company’s past reports, and projects its value and relative earnings. Fundamental analysts study the change in profitability of the corporation relative to its revenue trend, costs, and expenses, which will include an analysis of its business competition, its capitalization, and the strength of its business sectors. Fundamental analysts should be aware of the potential risk of change between the company’s latest report and its current situation. It takes generally at least three months from the cutoff date of the financial statements to have the audited results published. During that period, many things can happen and, as a result, the published results may not reflect the current state of the company’s financial position. Nonetheless, one would be foolish to ignore all fundamental analysis. Fundamentals are more determinable and deliver fewer surprise punches. After studying companies with consistent earnings and growth, it should be possible to forecast these companies’ earnings per share (EPS) and the likely range of their revenue and earnings growth. It might also be possible to estimate the return on equity and the dividend payout ratio based on each company’s dividend policy. However, it would be difficult to do so for companies with volatile levels of revenue and earnings. Investors look for steady growth in both earnings and dividend payout over time. This does not mean the investment dividend has to increase each year. The dividend payout ratio is an important sign. If the dividend payout ratio starts to make a series of declines, business may be turning ne
