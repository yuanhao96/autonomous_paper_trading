Chapter 8. The Rise of Gambling Opportunities There has been a dramatic increase in gambling opportunities in the United States in recent years. Most forms of gambling and lotteries were outlawed by states in the 1870s after a scandal in the P RE CIP ITATIN G FACTO RS 41 Louisiana lottery, and the Louisiana national lottery itself was effectively shut down by an 1890 act of Congress prohibiting the sale of lottery tickets by mail. From then until 1970, opportunities to gamble legally were conﬁned largely to racetracks, a form of gambling that has limited public appeal and which at the time required travel to a racetrack. But by 1975, there were thirteen state lotteries, and by 1999 there were thirty-seven, offering very convenient and easy means of wagering. Until 1990, legalized casinos operated only in Nevada and Atlantic City. By 1999 there were nearly 100 riverboat and dockside casinos and 260 casinos on Indian reservations. Over the same interval, betting at racetracks has also expanded dramatically, with the development of off-track betting, relying on satellite broadcasts of the races. Cable and Internet wagering on races is now possible from home. There has also been a proliferation of electronic gambling devices, including slot machines, video poker, video keno, and other stand-alone devices. In some states these may even be found at truck stops, convenience stores, and lottery outlets. The ubiquity and convenience of gambling opportunities, and the strength of the marketing campaign undertaken to promote gambling, are unprecedented in U.S. history. According to the 1999 report of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, 125 million Americans gambled in 1998—a ﬁgure that represents most of the adult population.37 Moreover, 7.5 million Americans were estimated to be either problem or pathological gamblers. The rise of gambling institutions, and the increased frequency of actual gambling, have potentially important effects on our culture and on changed attitudes toward risk taking in other areas, such as investing in the stock market. The legalization of gambling in the form of state lotteries has sometimes been observed to help the illegal numbers business, rather than replace it,38 and thus it might also promote other capricious risk-taking activities. Gambling suppresses natural inhibitions against taking risks, and some of the gambling contracts, in particular the lotteries, superﬁcially resemble financial markets: one deals with a computer, one receives a certiﬁcate (the lottery ticket), and, in the case of the socalled mega-lottos, one participates in a much-talked-about national 42 STR UC TUR AL FAC TOR S phenomenon. Having established a habit of participating in such gambling, it would be natural to graduate to its more upscale form, speculation in securities. The period of highest U.S. stock market volatility was 1929 to 1933, when volatility was more than twice as high as had ever been recorded before. This period of volatility occurred during a “gambling craze” that was brought on not by legalization but by the organized crime that was inadvertently created by the prohibition of alcoholic beverages during the period 1920–33.39 The criminal gangs that grew after 1920 to satisfy the nation’s thirst for alcohol found it natural to branch out into numbers games or speakeasy versions of craps and roulette. Organized crime developed a modern and efﬁcient distribution, marketing, and retail system to supply the nation at large with liquor, going far beyond its traditional neighborhood strongholds, and this same infrastructure served to facilitate illegal gambling activities on a much larger scale. Certainly the widespread disrespect for the law fostered by Prohibition helped legitimize gambling. A spillover from gambling to ﬁnancial volatility may come about because gambling, and the institutions that promote it, yield an inﬂated estimate of one’s own ultimate potential for good luck, a heightened interest in how one performs compared with others, and a new way to stimulate oneself out of a feeling of boredom or monotony. Today we are constantly subjected to highly professional advertisements that try to foster such attitudes, even radio and television advertisements that depict typical gamblers’ self-justiﬁcations as expressed by professional actors. These marketing efforts, and the experience of gambling or seeing others gamble, may well have the effect of encouraging frivolous risk-taking behavior in the stock market as well. Such ads may be startlingly explicit. A Connecticut billboard advertising off-track betting touts it, in big letters, as being “Like the Stock Market, Only Faster.” Summing Up Looking back at the list of potential precipitating factors for the stock market boom, it is worth remembering that there is no air-tight P RE CIP ITATIN G FACTO RS 43 science of stock market pricing. Economists have certainly made progress in understanding ﬁnancial markets, but the complexity of real life continues to prevail. Many of the foregoing factors have a self-fulﬁlling aspect to them, and they are thus difﬁcult, if not impossible, to capture in predictive scientiﬁc explanations. Yet many of them also have indisputable markers. The Internet boom, the rise of online trading, the Republican Congress, and the proposed capital gains tax cut occurred just as the market started its most breathtaking ascent. Other factors—including the rise of deﬁned contribution pension plans, the growth of mutual funds, the decline of inﬂation, and the expansion of the volume of trade—were clearly associated with events that unfolded since the bottom of the market in 1982. Beyond these, our culture clearly reﬂects further developments that have accompanied the surge in stocks. For example, studies reveal that the degree of materialism has risen steadily in the past generation, that patriotic zeal following the demise of Communism has contributed to our conﬁdence in the capitalist system
