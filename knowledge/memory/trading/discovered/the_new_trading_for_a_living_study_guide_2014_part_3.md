Part 7). Before we work on a system, let’s review other types of indicators available to market analysts (Parts 5 and 6). ■■Recommended Reading Murphy, John J., Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets (New York: New York Institute of Finance, 1999).

Since one of them is bound to be right and the other wrong, volume represents the activity of winners and losers. It surges when losers panic. It mirrors current activity but doesn’t forecast the future. Answer 5-2: 1 = B; 2 = A; 3 = C; 4 = D Trends tend to persist when the volume is steady or rises in an orderly manner. They usually expire with either a bang or a whimper—a burst of volume or its drastic shrinkage. The trend cannot continue after masses of losers start leaving. Answer 5-3: 1 = D; 2 = A and B; 3 = C and F; 4 = E and G Rising or steady volume confirms trends. When prices rise to a new high or fall to a new low while volume shrinks, it tells us that the price trend is likely to reverse or at least to pause. Answer 5-4: B There is a powerful rally going on, with a steady pattern of higher highs and lows. CPST is slowly declining from its latest high, while volume is shrinking. Wait for a bar or a few bars that fail to reach a new low for this minor downmove—and then go long. 113 114 ANSWERS Answer 5-5: C (I, II, and III) OBV is created by adding each day’s volume to a running total when a trading vehicle rises and subtracting it on the days when that vehicle falls. OBV confirms bull moves when it rises to a higher high than at the previous peak; it confirms declines when it falls to a lower low than at the previous bottom. Prices represent the consensus of value, while volume, measured by OBV, tracks traders’ emotions. Answer 5-6: 1 = D; 2 = C; 3 = B; 4 = A Opening and closing prices are among the most important prices of the day. Openings tend to be dominated by amateurs whose orders flood the markets in the mornings. Closings tend to be dominated by professionals who monitor the conditions all day. Accumulation/Distribution ties daily volume to the relationship between opening and closing prices. Answer 5-7: B The number of long and short positions in the derivatives markets is always equal. While stocks represent current ownership, derivatives are contracts for future delivery. Each contract has two sides: a seller and a buyer. This is why open interest reflects the number of contracts held by longs or owed by shorts in any given market on any given day. It equals the total long or the total short position. Answer 5-8: 1 = B; 2 = C; 3 = C; 4 = A Open interest rises only when a new buyer and a new seller enter the market because their trade creates a new contract. Open interest falls when a bull who is long sells his contract to a bear who buys it to cover his short trade, and both close out their positions. If a new bull buys from an old bull who’s getting out, open interest remains unchanged. Nor does it change when a new bear sells to an old bear who buys to get out of his short position. Answer 5-9: D (1, 2, 3, and 4) When open interest rises, it shows that a crowd of confident bulls is facing down a crowd of equally confident bears. One group is sure to lose, but as long as potential losers keep pouring in, the trend is likely to continue. Answer 5-10: C (1, 2, and 3) The direction of the move shows whether the dominant force was up or down. The distance between today’s and yesterday’s closing prices reflects the margin of victory by bulls or bears. High-volume rallies and declines are more forceful and more likely to persist.While related markets are important, they don’t reflect the force of moves elsewhere.

To calculate the daily Force Index, subtract yesterday’s closing price from today’s and multiply the result, whether positive or negative, by today’s volume. Answer 5-12: D (I, II, III, and IV) Smoothing the raw Force Index with a moving average helps recognize its trend—a short-term trend using a short EMA or an intermediate trend using a longer EMA. When the 2-day EMA of Force Index dips below zero during market rallies, it identifies buying opportunities, and when it rallies above zero during market drops, it marks shorting opportunities. The 13-day EMA of Force Index helps identify bullish and bearish zones by its position above or below its zero line. Divergences between Force Index and price tend to mark approaching trend reversals. Answer 5-13: 1 = G and H; 2 = F; 3 = A, B, C, and D; 4 = E In the left half of the chart, prices are in a downtrend, confirmed by a falling EMA. Whenever the 2-day EMA of Force Index rises above zero, it shows a brief recovery by the bulls—a shorting opportunity. In area E, prices fall to a new low but recoil from it, leaving behind a false downside breakout, while Force Index traces a bullish divergence, with a much more shallow low. This is a good time to cover shorts. In area F, the EMA of prices turns up—it signals to stop shorting and look for buying opportunities. Afterwards, Force Index declines below zero in areas G and H, giving buy signals. Answer 5-14: B At the right edge of the screen, a moving average of price is trending higher, indicating an uptrend. The 2-day Force Index has dipped below zero, signaling that the stock is short-term oversold and giving a buy signal. You have two main ways to act on this signal. You may place a buy order at the high of the current bar, aiming to catch an upside breakout. Alternatively, you may measure the extent of an average downside penetration of the EMA and place your buy order at a similar distance below the current EMA. Answer 5-15
