this work. We can only surmise why the author felt he had to publish a second work of a similar nature to the one he had written two years earlier. We have to think that while he must have felt the earlier book with its 250-plus pages devoted to technical subjects gave good coverage of what he wanted to say, he had come to the conclusion that there was a great deal more he could expound on to advance Technical Analysis as a serious analytical approach in investment thinking, a more comprehensive presentation worthy of the subject. The end result was this Course and masterpiece that we now can say was well in keeping with his later recognition as “the father of modern Technical Analysis.” Nevertheless, most technical analysts today still remain unaware of Mr Schabacker’s place in the order of things or his contributions to what is now the most popular form of investment analysis, Technical Analysis. However, with this re-publishing of Schabacker’s finest writings, it is hoped an awakening appreciation will sweep the cobwebs of anonymity away from this extremely important contributor to our world of analytical thought and application. For any trader or investor, from the rankest beginner to the most experienced institutional fund manager, the most critical point that lies at the heart of any investment position they hold is when they find they have to ask themselves as the trend evolves whether that position is at a peak with a possible reversal in the offing or, as the case may be, at a bottom and a possible reversal in that price movement. Depending on whether they are taking a long-term, a more intermediate-term, or a short-term view (and they are all relative in respect to time), that change of trend could make a vital difference to a profit gained or a loss sustained for that position. This would also hold true for any buying decision or short sale decision being considered as the price action goes through its upside/downside contortions. For this reason Mr Schabacker chose to make Reversal Patterns the area he would give the greatest emphasis and attention to in the Course, and in so doing stressed the importance of this knowledge in the education of technical students, who see themselves as intertwined in the dynamics of the marketplace. (In truth we who see ourselves as students of the market know we are destined to attend Analysis University for as long we are market-oriented. With the potential pool of knowledge that is there to – xiv – EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION be explored, and our time on this planet so relatively limited, there can never be an end to our learning experience. The only possible graduation ceremony we can expect from our University has to be when we graduate to those Great Stock and Commodity Markets in the Sky.) In surveying the broad range of Reversal Patterns to be covered in the Course, the initial formation the Author chose and the obvious one to feature was the one that most exemplified reversal indications, the Head
