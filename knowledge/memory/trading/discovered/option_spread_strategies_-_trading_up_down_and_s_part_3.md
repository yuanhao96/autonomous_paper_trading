The Greeks • Delta of a Covered-Write The delta of a covered-write position is simply the sum of the deltas of the components. Example What is the delta of a covered-write consisting of 100 shares of long stock and short 1 call with a .50 delta? 100  (100  .50)  100  (50)  50 shares Note that the delta of the call is reversed because it is a short call. Gamma The delta of an option does not remain constant because it is sensitive to changes in market conditions, one of these being changes in underlying price. Gamma describes the sensitivity (rate of change) of an option’s delta with respect to changes in the underlying price. The convention is to express gamma in terms of the change in delta produced by a one-point move in the underlying. For example, if the delta of a 100 call changed from 0.50 to 0.60 as the underlying moved from 100.00 to 101.00, the call would be said to have a gamma of .10 because the delta changed by .10 as the underlying price rose. If the underlying price declined from 100.00 to 99.00, the delta of the call would fall from 0.50 to 0.40. This would have an impact on the delta of a covered-write position because as the underlying price changed, the delta of the short call would change, affecting the delta of the overall position. Example An investor has a covered-write position consisting of 100 shares of long stock and short one .50 delta call. The call has a gamma of .10. What is the delta of the overall position if: The stock rises 1.00 . . . 100  (100  (0.50  0.10))  40 shares The stock falls 1.00 . . . 100  (100  (0.50  0.10))  60 shares Note that the gamma simply increases or decreases the delta of the option as the underlying price changes; it does not change whether the delta is positive or negative. The gamma of an option is not linear and is also sensitive to market conditions. It is highly dependent on the location of the strike price relative to the underlying price (sometimes called moneyness) and the time left until expiration. Figure 1.5 shows the relationship between the gamma of an option, moneyness, and time until expiration. 9
