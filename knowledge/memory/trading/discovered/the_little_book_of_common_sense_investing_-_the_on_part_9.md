Chapter 4, the index fund has provided excellent protection from the penalty of these costs. While its real returns also were hurt by inflation, the cumulative impact was far less than on the actively managed equity funds. But there is yet another cost—too often ignored—that slashes even further the net returns that investors actually TA X E S A R E C O S TS , T O O [61] receive. I’m referring to taxes—federal, state, and local income taxes.* And here again, the index fund garners a substantial edge. The fact is that most managed mutual funds are astonishingly tax-inefficient, a result of the shortterm focus of their portfolio managers, usually frenetic traders of the stocks in the portfolios they supervise.  Managed mutual funds are astonishingly tax-inefficient. The turnover of the average equity fund now comes to about 100 percent per year. (In fairness, based on total assets rather than number of funds, the turnover rate of actively managed funds is 61 percent.) Industrywide, the average stock is held by the average fund for an average of just 12 months. (Based on equity fund total assets, only 20 months.) Hard as it is to imagine, from 1945 to 1965, the turnover rate averaged just 16 percent per year, an average holding period of six years for the average stock in a fund portfolio. This huge increase in turnover and its attendant transaction costs have ill-served fund investors. * About one-half of all equity mutual fund shares are held by individual investors in fully taxable investment accounts. The other half are held in taxdeferred accounts such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and corporate savings, thrift, and profit-sharing plans. If your fund holdings are solely in the latter category, you need not be concerned with the discussion in this chapter. [62] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING This pattern of tax-inefficiency for active managers seems destined to continue as long as (1) stocks rise, and (2) fund managers continue their hyperactive patterns of short-term trading. Let’s be clear: Most fund managers, once focused on long-term investment, are now focused on short-term speculation. But the index fund follows precisely the opposite policy—buying and holding forever, and incurring transaction costs that are somewhere between infinitesimal and zero. So let’s pick up where we left off two chapters ago, with the net annual return of 10.0 percent for the average equity fund over the past 25 years can be compared with the 12.3 percent return for the S&P 500 Index fund. With the high portfolio turnover of actively managed funds, their taxable investors were subject to an estimated effective annual federal tax of 1.8 percentage points per year (state and local taxes would further balloon the figure), reducing the after-tax annual return to 8.2 percent (Exhibit 6.1). Despite the higher returns that they earned, investors in the index fund were actually subjected to lower taxes—in fact, at 0.6 percentage points, only about one-third of that tax burden—bringing their after-tax return to 11.7 percent. Compounded, the initial $10,000 investment grew by just $61,700 after taxes for the active funds, nearly 60 percent less than TA X E S A R E C O S TS , T O O [63] EXHIBIT 6.1 Index Fund versus Managed Fund: Profit on Initial Investment of $10,000, 1980 –2005 200 $179,200 $179,200 Gross Return $170,800 Pre-tax Return Thousands ($) 150 $149,000 After-tax Return Real Return 100 $98,200 $65,100 $61,700 50 $23,100 0 Index Fund Average Fund Note: Assumes reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. the $149,000 of accumulated growth in the index fund, a loss of some $87,300.* What’s more, just as fund expenses are paid in current dollars, so is your annual tax bill. When we calculate the accumulated wealth in terms of real dollars with 1980 buying power, investor wealth again contracts dramatically. The annual real return of the average equity fund now drops to 4.9 percent, less than 60 percent of the 8.4 *The index fund investor would be subject to taxes on any gains realized when liquidating shares. But for an investor who bequeaths shares to heirs, the cost would be “stepped up” to their market value on date of death and no capital gain would be recognized or taxed. [64] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING percent actual return of the index fund. Compounded, the real after-tax accumulation on that initial $10,000 came to $65,100 for the index fund, nearly three times the $23,100 for the active equity index fund. Even with the more subdued returns earned in the postbubble era, actively managed funds persist in foisting this extraordinarily costly tax inefficiency on their shareholders. While the net annual return of the average equity fund was 8.5 percent over the past decade (1996 to 2005), the tax bill consumed fully 1.7 percentage points of the return, reducing the net fund return to just 6.8 percent. I hesitate to assign the responsibility for being “the straw that broke the camel’s back” of equity fund returns to any single one of these negative factors. But surely the final straws include (1) high costs, (2) the adverse investor selections and counterproductive market timing described in
