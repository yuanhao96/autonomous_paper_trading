Chapter 6 Getting Closer to the Truth Beginning proof the market is not random and our first -key- to market explosions. Losers of Any game typically lament that either the game was rigged. or it is one no one can beat; thus, their failure is excusable. Well, the game of the market has been beaten by many people for many years. So while I have read the laments of the academicians such as Paul Cootner in his classic, The Random Character of Stock Prices, whose morose verdict is that prices cannot be predicted: past price activity has no bearing on what will happen tomorrow. or next week for that matter. This is true, he and a host of other apparently nontrading authors suggest, because the market is efficient. All that is to be known is known and thus already reflected in current prices. Therefore. today's price change can only be caused by new information (news) coming to the marketplace. The bottom line of these authors is that returns from one day to the next are independent, thus price is impacted by random variables which accounts for the notion that prices move totally by random, thus defy prediction. Believing in this random walk means acknowledging that the market is efficient, that all is known. Obviously, you do not accept this concept; you spent hard-earned money on this book thinking that perhaps I. can teach you, something most other traders or investors do not know. 81 82 You are right! Cootner and his crowd apparently tested for dependence on future action of price in a one-dimensional approach. I suspect they may have tested future price change based on some sort of moving averages, thus while looking for the right direction, they used the wrong tools. If there is no dependency on price action, over a long time period, 50 percent of the days a market should close higher and 50 percent of the time lower. It is supposed to be like flipping a coin-the coin has no memory. Each new toss is not biased by what went on in the past. If I were to flip such a fair coin on Tuesdays, I would get the same 50/50 heads and tails as I would by flipping on any other day of the week. The Market Is Not a Coin Flip If the Cootner theory is correct and market activity is random, then a test of day-to-day price change should be easy to establish. We can start with a very simple question: "If market activity is random, should not the daily trading range, each day's high minus the close, be just about the same regardless of which day of the week it is? " Also one should ask, "If all price action is random, would you not expect the daily change, regardless of being up or down, just the absolute value of daily changes to be about the same for each day of the week" And finally, "If price is random, is it not true that no one day of the week could or would show a strong bias up or down'-" If the market has no memory, it surely should not matter which day you flip the coin or take your trades. The truth is it does matter, a great deal. Instead of listening to the theorists, I went to the market to see what it had to say. I asked the preceding questions and many others to see whether there is dependency from one day to the next or one pattern or past certain price action that consistently influences tomorrow's price past the critical random walk point. The answer was clear; the market does not reflect Cootner's claim. Tables 6.1 and 6.2 prove my point. 83 I have sampled two of the biggest, and thus you would think the most efficient markets, the S&P 500, a measure of 500 stocks, and the United States Treasury Bonds. My first question was, Is there a difference in the size of the range for different days of the week? Next, Does the distance change from the open to the close, depend on the day of the week? And finally, I looked at the net price change each day. In Cootner's world, all these questions should produce a homogeneous response; there should be no or little variance. For the S&P 500 Tuesdays and Fridays consistently had daily ranges larger than any other time period. For the Bond market, Thursdays and Fridays had the largest daily ranges. Could it be that not all days are created equally? You bet, or had better bet, because the second column for each market shows the absolute value of the price swing from the open to the close also varies widely. In the S&P 500 the largest open to close change takes place on Mondays at an average of .631 while the smallest takes place on Thursdays with -.044. In the Bond market the difference is even larger Tuesdays saw the largest open to close change, .645 and the smallest on Mondays with -.001!. Finally, check out the last column to see that in both set s of data for the S&P 500 Fridays have a negative value and in Bonds, Monday and Thursday show negative changes for these days. Cootner should say this is impossible, in an efficient market one day should not be pre-disposed to rally or decline more than any other. The market tells us otherwise, some days of the week are in fact better for buying or selling than others' I want to drive this point home: Cootner and his crowd apparently did not test for day of the week dependency. I conducted a study where we asked the computer to buy on the opening each day and exit on the close. I ran this test on all the grain markets (not shown). While not a trading system on its own, the data opens a door and gives us an advantage those who put this book back on the shelves don't have. The data makes clear: All the grain markets have a pronounced pattern of rallying more on Wednesdays than any other day of the week. 84 Go ahead, check it out, what happened to that random walk? Sure looks like it gets stuck on Wednesdays in the grains. What is evident here is an advantage to the game. Granted, it is small, but casinos work of an advantage of usually 1.5 percent to 4 percent in most of their games of random chances. It is that tiny percentage, played often enough, that builds all those hotels and subsidizes the buffet lines.
