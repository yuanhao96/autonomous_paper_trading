Introduction I have always considered myself lucky. When I was 10 years old, my mother’s favorite performer from Hong Kong was doing a retirement concert in Atlantic City. The concert hall was packed with what must have been more than 1,000 people. When we took our seats, the performer told us that there would be a surprise giveaway of memorabilia from her past performances. When I was picked, I screamed in delight at winning a gorgeous antique watch. A few years later, I won a sweepstakes for a free Hawaiian vacation. I graduated college when I was just 18 years old, landed one of the first jobs that I’ve ever interviewed for, got out of the stock market before the technology bubble burst, met the man of my dreams at 23, and was never at risk of losing my job during the global financial crisis. Lady Luck has certainly smiled on me and I won’t take her for granted, but being lucky was not the only thing that got me where I am today. I doubt that New York University’s Stern School of Business would have let me graduate college at an age when most people graduate high school just because of luck. Being smart, having a strong work ethic, recognizing opportunities when they appear, and knowing how to grab them is just as important as being lucky. In other words, luck needs to be combined with skill. Over the past few years, we’ve all had to deal with financial crises. A lot of people lost their shirts and many are still struggling to recover. Those who survived without great loss are lucky. But should we be content with just being lucky? After all, some people not only survived but thrived during the financial crisis. When a crisis hits, you can sit back and watch in shock as your money evaporates or you can go on the offensive and take advantage of the opportunities in front of you. The key is to recognize those opportunities and know how to act on them when they appear. One increasingly popular way of capitalizing on the up and down movements in the financial markets is through currencies. Between 2004 and 2010, the daily turnover or volume in the forex market more than doubled from $1.9 trillion to $4 trillion. Before the technology boom, investing and trading in the forex market was limited to institutional investors, hedge funds, and other deep-pocketed players. However, that changed when foreign exchange brokers brought their platforms online and made the market available to individual traders. Since then the number of people trading forex has exploded and it is only expected to grow. Many people have already discovered forex trading—it may be time for you to learn why the market has become so popular, too. Foreign exchange movements touch everyone’s lives in one way or another. Whether you’ve traded forex before or not, you’ve bought and sold currencies. If you’ve traveled abroad or bought something on eBay from a seller in another country, that counts! Or if you are a small-business owner, you trade forex when you buy and sell products imported from other countries. Maybe you think you’re exempt from needing to know about forex trading because you invest solely in U.S. stocks. But that’s not true anymore. If the companies you invest in have any foreign operations or payables and receivables in different currencies, you’re still exposed to currency risk. As a result, it is important for any trader or investor to stay on top of exchange rates and to know how much currencies are worth. Of course, the sharp increase in foreign exchange trading activity is not just due to people following currencies. Investors and traders are participating in the market for speculation, hedging, investment, and other transactional purposes. There are many different ways to trade currencies; one of the best ways to get started is to trade what you know. Big stories and headlines in the financial markets that affect equities will generally affect currencies. So if you hear a story that is bad for a country’s economy or gives foreign investors cause to be nervous, then
