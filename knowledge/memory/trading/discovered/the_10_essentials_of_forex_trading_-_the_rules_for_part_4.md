CHAPTER 1 7. SO YOU WANT TO TRADE FOREX? 9 and accidents, you are considered an unconsciously competent driver. You have now become unconsciously competent in your successful driving habits. You probably take about three seconds to pull out of the driveway, probably driving part of the way with your knee as you juggle a cup of coffee in one hand and a cell phone in the other, focusing on the conversation rather than each individual skill needed to drive the car. Can you see how powerful your mind is and how critically important it is to properly think through everything before you act? When it is time to trade, you must think before you act. If you act before you think and make mistakes, your subconscious mind will take over and record all your ignorant actions and subconsciously create bad trading habits. That is how you start to lose money or just get by in trading. Successful traders think before they act to execute successful trading habits. Failure is like cancer. You don’t treat cancer by cutting it out. If you have to remove the cancer, much of the time it is too late. You treat cancer by preventing it and you treat success by creating good habits from the beginning. This way you are preventing failure. As you learn to trade, you will need to get in the habit of thinking through all the details potentially involved with that trade. You will need to have checklists that cover all the details. You will need to get in the habit of creating a trading plan and maintaining the discipline of trading your plan. That habit forces you to think before you act, avoiding impulsive, emotional actions that generate unsuccessful trades. The market has no remorse for ignorance and impulsive action. The ignorant will suffer. Think before you act. Do you manage your emotions or do your emotions manage you? Most financially successful people are very unemotional when it comes to business decisions. Believe it or not, successful business is nothing more than making and executing unemotional decisions that make economic sense. It is no different than unemotionally figuring out a mathematical equation. Two plus two will always equal four, regardless of how desperately you wanted it to be five—it will always equal four. Unsuccessful business is nothing more than making and executing emotional decisions that don’t make economic sense. For example, holding onto unproductive employees because you like them, does not make economic sense and is a bad business decision rooted in emotion. 10 8. THE 10 ESSENTIALS OF FOREX TRADING In life, there are good emotions and bad emotions. The bad emotions usually don’t serve us well, whereas the good emotions enhance our lives. When it comes to business, you need to make all your decisions unemotionally. Your decision process needs to be educated, logical, and unemotional. Any financial decision made in the heat of negative emotion will hurt you much more than it will ever help you. When it is time to trade, the more you rely on your emotions to make your decisions, the more money you will lose. The more you rely on your education and logic, the more money you will make. Thinking through problems unemotionally allows you to stay focused on achieving long-term happiness and success. Bad things happen to all of us, and many times we have no control over them. The reality is that we have no control over the cards we are dealt, we only have control over what we do with those cards. What we do have control over is how we handle the situation—emotionally or unemotionally. Successful traders manage their emotions; unsuccessful traders let their emotions manage them. Are you responsive or reactive? When something doesn’t go according to plan or doesn’t go your way, do you throw a temper tantrum and have a “mental meltdown”? Unsuccessful people usually do. Successful and positive-thinking people are able to process properly the negative things that happen to them, put them into perspective, and move on. If your emotions control you, you are going to be more reactive than responsive and you will probably go through life with unhappiness, poverty, and mediocrity. As a rule, just about everything negative that happens to us is either self-inflicted or the result of not paying attention to red flags, warnings signs, or details. Accepting responsibility for our own actions is such a painful event that we find it easier to react and blame someone else rather than analyzing what really happened and responding by creating a system to avoid that situation again. If you bring your reactive bad habits to the trading table, the market will know exactly which emotional buttons to push. When it does, you will run like a scared rabbit being pursued by a pack of hungry wolves. Running scared is not conducive to calming down and thinking through your next move. Reacting versus calmly thinking through the situation and responding eliminates your ability to see clearly what happened. When it comes to any crisis, in trading or otherwise, you owe it to yourself to respond logically,
