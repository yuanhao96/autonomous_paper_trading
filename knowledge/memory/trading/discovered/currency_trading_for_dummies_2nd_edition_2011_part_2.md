Part II: Driving Forces behind Currencies In this part I look at the major fundamental and economic drivers that influence currency values. Also, whether it’s economic data out of the United Kingdom or a political spat in the land down under (that’s Australia, mate!), the forex market moves in response to developments from around the world. I show you how to interpret the data and events like a pro, factoring in market psychology and positioning. I also draw on my years of experience to offer insights that clue you in to how major currencies typically trade so you can know what to expect before you take the plunge.
