Chapter 28 of the Basing Points Procedure he will be able to go to the website and print out a PDF of material that he can place beside Figure 210.1 for instant and easy cross reference, instead of having to turn pages constantly back and forth from the chart to the keys and commentary, or having to bend the book into pretzels at a copy machine. In general, wherever references are made in the text to the website it is for this purpose, to give the reader easy and flexible usage of the material. And, likewise, at this address the reader will find links to past letters that show how the method functioned in real time in real markets. A Special Note about Dow Theory Senator Everett Dirkson said one time that trying to get U.S. Senators herded together and moving in one direction was like trying to transport bull frogs in a wheelbarrow. Trying to synchronize the signals of the various Dow Theory analysts is a similarly challenging proposition. No Ayatollah exists to issue the final fatwa as to whether the signal is valid. Always one to abhor a vacuum I have organized a committee at Golden Gate University to evaluate pronouncements of signals and opine as to whether the signals are valid. This committee may be contacted at the addresses found in Resources and at cbassetti@ggu.edu. Acknowledgments for the Ninth Edition For professional assistance: Jack Schannep, Robert W.

A book written in the mid-20th century retains its relevancy and importance to the present day. In fact, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends remains the definitive book on the subject of analyzing the stock market with charts. Knock-offs, look-alikes, pale imitations have proliferated in its wake like sea gulls after a productive fishing boat. But the truth is they have added nothing new to the body of knowledge Edwards and Magee originally produced and Magee refined up to the 5th edition. What accounts for this rare occasion of a book’s passing to be a classic? To be more, in fact, than a classic, to be the manual or handbook for current usage? To answer this question we must ask another. What are Chart formations? Chart formations identified and analyzed by the authors are graphic representations of unchanging human behavior in complex multivariate situations. They are the depiction of multifarious human actions bearing on a single variable (price). On price converge a galaxy of influences: fear, greed, desire, cunning, malice, deceit, naiveté, earnings estimates, broker need for income, gullibility, professional money managers’ need for performance and job security, supply and demand of stocks, monetary liquidity and money flow, selfdestructiveness, passivity, trap setting, manipulation, blind arrogance, conspiracy and fraud and double dealing, phases of the moon and sun spots, economic cycles and beliefs about them, public mood, and the indomitable human need to be right. Chart formations are the language of the market, telling us that this stock is in its death throes; that stock is on a rocket to the moon; that a life and death battle is being waged in this issue; and in that other, the buyers have defeated the sellers and are breaking away. They are, in short, the inerasable fingerprints of human nature made graphic in the greatest struggle, next to war, in human experience. As Freud mapped the human psyche, so have Edwards and Magee mapped the human mind and emotions as expressed in the financial markets. Not only did they produce a definitive map, they also produced a methodology for interpreting and profiting from the behavior of men and markets. It is difficult to imagine further progress in this area until the science of artificial intelligence, aided by yet unimaginable computer hardware, makes new breakthroughs. If It Is Definitive, Why Offer a New Edition? Unlike Nostradamus and Jules Verne (and many current investment advisors), the authors did not have a crystal ball or a time machine. Magee did not AU3772_C000.fm Page 10 Tuesday, November 21, 2006 1:50 PM foresee the electronic calculator and made do with a slide rule. And while he knew of the computer, he did not anticipate that every housewife and investor would have 1000 times the power of a Whirlwind or Univac I on his (her) desk (cf. Note on Gender). In short, the March of Time. The Progress of Science. The Inexorable Advance of Technology. Amazingly, the great majority of this book needed no update or actualization. Who is to imp
