Chapter 23, which I have surreptitiously inserted). Absolutely Necessary Revisions Which Will Have Arisen in the Thirty Minutes Since This Editorial Note Was Written In a number of instances, the book relayed information which, in those days of fixed commissions and monopolistic control by the existing exchanges, remained valid for long periods of time, for instance, brokerage commissions and trading costs. It is no longer possible to maintain such information in a printed book because of the rate of change in the financial industry. It must now be filed and updated in real time on the Internet. Consequently, readers will be able to refer to the Internet for this kind of ephemeral data. The general importance of the ephemera to the subject is always discussed. About Gender I quote here from my foreword to the 2nd edition of Magee’s General Semantics of Wall Street, (charmingly renamed according to the current fashions, Winning the Mental Game on Wall Street): About Gender in Grammar Ich bin ein feminist. How could any modern man, son of a beloved woman, husband of an adored woman, and father of a joyful and delightful daughter not be? I am also a traditionalist and purist in matters of usage, grammar, and style. So where does that leave me and my cogenerationalists, enlightened literary (sigh) men (and women) with regards to the use of the masculine pronoun when used in the general sense to apply to the neuter situation? In Dictionary of Modern American Usage, Garner notes: ‘English has a number of common-sex general words, such as person, anyone, everyone, and no one, but it has no common-sex singular personal pronouns. Instead we have he, she, and it. The traditional approach has been to use the masculine pronouns he and him to cover all persons, male and female alike... . The inadequacy of the English language in this respect becomes apparent in many sentences in which the generic masculine pronoun sits uneasily.’ AU3772_C000.fm Page 18 Tuesday, November 21, 2006 1:50 PM Inadequate or not it is preferable to s/he/it and other bastardizations of the English language. (Is it not interesting that “bastard,” in common usage, is never used of a woman, even when she is illegitimate?) As for the legitimacy of the usage of the masculine (actually neuter) pronoun in the generic, I prefer to lean on Fowler, who says, ‘There are three makeshifts: first as anybody can see for himself or herself; second, as anybody can see for themselves; and third, as anybody can see for himself. No one who can help it chooses the first; it is correct, and is sometimes necessary, but it is so clumsy as to be ridiculous except when explicitness is urgent, and it usually sounds like a bit of pedantic humor. The second is the popular solution; it sets the literary man’s (!) teeth on edge, and he exerts himself to give the same meaning in some entirely different way if he is not prepared to risk the third, which is here recommended. It involves the convention (statutory in the interpretation of documents) that where the matter of sex is not conspicuous or important the masculine form shall be allowed to represent a person instead of a man, or say a man (homo) instead of a man (vir).’ Politically correct fanatics may rail, but so are my teeth set on edge; thus, I have generally preserved the authors’ usage of the masculine for the generic case. This grammatical scourge will pass and be forgotten, and weak-willed myn (by which I intend to indicate men and women) who pander to grammatical terrorists will in the future be seen to be stuck with malformed style and sentences no womyn will buy. What would Jane Austen have done, after all? About Gender in Investors As long as we are on the subject of gender, we might as well discuss, unscientifically, gender in investors. Within my wide experience as a trading advisor, teacher, and counselor, it strikes me that the women investors I have known have possessed certain innate advantages over the men. I know there are women gamblers. I have seen some. But I have never seen in the markets a woman plunger (shooter, pyramider, pie-eyed gambler). I have known many men who fit AU3772_C000.fm Page 19 Tuesday, November 21, 2006 1:50 PM this description. I have also noted among my students and clients that as a group women seem to have more patience than men as a group. I refer specifically to the patience that a wise investor must have to allow the markets to do what they are going to do. These are wholly personal observations. I have made no study of the question and can’t speak to the entire class of women investors — and do not personally know Barbra Streisand (who I understand is a formidable investor, especially in IPOs). But just as I believe that the world would be better off if more women ran countries and were police officers, I expect that the world of finance will benefit from the steadily increasing number of women investors and managers. A Crucial Question — Sensitivity Indexes and Betas Long before the investment community had formalized the beta measure — the coefficient measuring a stock’s volatility relative to the market — Magee and Edwards were computing a Sensitivity Index, which, for all practical purposes, was the same thing. Readers interested in this aspect of their work may find references in Resources which will enable them to obtain betas to plug into the Composite Leverage formula with which Magee intended to determine risk levels. The old appendix on Sensitivity Indexes has been consigned to Appendix A, along with the chapter on Composite Leverage, both originals of which have been emended to reflect current practices in finance theory and practice. Betwixt and Between, 1/8 of a Dollar or 12.5 Cents As this edition went to press the financial services industry was once again threatening to implement decimals in stock prices. Pricing in eighths has endured long past its time because it was in the self-interest of the financial industry — it allowed brokers a
