Section 01 | Introduction and key concepts Advice from Warren Buffet To those who dislike big risks If you don’t like taking big risk, then take the advice from Warren Buffet - the most successful investor. This is the advice he gave to his own testament money managers: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s). I believe the index’s long-term results will be superior to those attained by most investors. Proof A $100,000 investment in the S&P 500 in February 1977 would be worth about $6 million as of the end of 2015, included reinvested dividends. ...When the dumb investor realises how dumb he is and buys an index fund, he becomes smarter than the smartest investors.
