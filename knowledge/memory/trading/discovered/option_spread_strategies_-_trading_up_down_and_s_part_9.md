Chapter 1 The Covered-Write Once again remember that the first and most important determining factor for a covered-write strategy is a neutral to mildly bullish forecast for the underlying price. Low implied volatility is an indication that market participants may have built in the possibility of less than usual movement in the underlying price both to the upside and downside. In other words, they see potentially less risk, and because of that, option prices and rates of return on a covered-write are somewhat lower to reflect this perceived relatively reduced risk. TRADE MANAGEMENT Regardless of whether one falls into the short-term or long-term, highrisk or low-risk category, one thing is for sure: After the trade is selected and executed, it will have to be managed. As time passes and the underlying moves up or down, adjustments will have to be made. As we have mentioned time and again in the preceding pages, the covered-write is a neutral to moderately bullish strategy. If the behavior of the underlying deviates from that scenario, that is, moves too far to the upside or too far to the downside, action will need to be taken. When expiration approaches and the written call loses all of its extrinsic value, action will need to be taken, and, of course, if one’s market view changes or if one wishes to lock in profits or reduce losses, action will need to be taken. The covered-write is not the “forget about it and watch the money roll in” strategy as seen on late-night television. Adjustments • Situation 1: Change in Market View Once again, the covered-write is a strategy to be applied in a neutral to moderately bullish environment. If one’s market view suddenly shifts away from neutral to moderately bullish (that is, becomes bearish or rampantly bullish) then the covered-write is an inappropriate strategy and should be liquidated. There are actually two ways to exit a covered-write quickly. One is to liquidate the original position as: Example 1: Liquidation of a Covered-Write Consisting of Long 100 Shares of XYZ and Short 1 XYZ June 100 Call +100 –100 +100 Calls –1 Strike 100 Original Position Puts Calls +1 –1 Strike 100 Closing Trade Puts Trade Management The second method is to utilize a synthetic relationship that exists between a covered-write position and the put of the same strike and expiration. A covered-write is actually the synthetic equivalent of a short put of the same strike and expiration of the short call component of the covered-write. This means that the covered-write behaves exactly as a short put in terms of the risk, reward, and break-even points of the position. So a quick way to cauterize a covered-write position is to purchase the put of the same strike and expiration cycle as the short call in the covered-write position. Example 2: Liquidation of a Covered-Write Consisting of Long 100 Shares of XYZ and Short 1 XYZ June 100 Call Using the Synthetically Equivalent Position +100 +100 Calls –1 Strike 100 Original Position Puts Calls –1 Strike 100 Puts +1 Closing Trade Using this technique leaves a residual arbitrage position known as a conversion. The conversion has very little risk but still may require some capital to hold, and it may or may not have to be managed at expiration regarding the exercise of the long put. This liquidation option is meant for an emergency situation in which one has to bail out of the position quickly. • Situation 2: Underlying Moves Up Through the Strike Once the underlying stock or index moves up through the strike, the upside profit potential of the covered-write is capped. In order to give the position some more upside potential, the short call has to be “rolled up” to a higher strike. This can be accomplished by buying a vertical call spread, covering the short call, and selling a higher strike call in the same expiration month. Or it can be accomplished by executing a diagonal call spread known as an up and out—covering the short call and selling a higher strike call in a further deferred expiration month. Which method is chosen usually depends on the cost of the “roll.” The purchase of a long call spread will cost the investor some money, thus adding to the cost basis of the position, whereas the up and out diagonal call spread will usually cost less, or depending on the time to expiration of the call to be sold, could even be executed for no cost or a credit. For this reason, many covered writers opt for the diagonal up and out adjustment. 21 22
