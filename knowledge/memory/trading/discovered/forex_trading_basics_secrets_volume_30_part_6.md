Section 01 | Introduction and key concepts Leverage, Lots & Spread Term Leverage Through the use of leverage, traders are able to invest a small amount of money and trade much larger deal sizes. This is useful because the movement in currency rates can be very small, and larger trades represent larger profits/losses for every pip change in the rate. Leverage allows you to trade with more money than you have in your account, because you effectively “leverage” your free balance to open a larger trade. Leverage is shown as a ratio, for example 1:100. Note that leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses alike. Stock market Forex market 1:2 from 1:10 to 1:400 Maximum leverage Varying lot sizes Term Lot In Forex, all transactions can be conducted via standard, mini, and micro lots. Each lot size accounts for a different measure of units of the base currency, which in turn presents a different pip value. Below is a simple chart to illustrate the differences in lot sizes, measured in units, volume for the major pairs where the base currency is USD. Units of base currency Volume Pip Value (base: USD) Standard Lot 100,000 units 1 1 pip = $10 Mini Lot 10,000 units 0.1 1 pip = $1 MicroLot Mini Lot 10’000units 1,000 units 0.1 0.01 11pip pip==$1 $0.10 The smaller contract sizes have a broad appeal to beginner investors who do not want to take on a disproportional amount of risk. Those traders who are looking to get started in the forex market should consider opening a mini account because of the smaller contract sizes. Term Spread The difference between the bid price and the ask price is called a spread. If we were to look at the following quote: EUR/USD = 1.2500/03, the spread would be 0.0003 or 3 pips, also known as points. Although these movements may seem insignificant, even the smallest point change can result in thousands of dollars being made or lost due to leverage. Again, this is one of the reasons that speculators are so attracted to the forex market; even the tiniest price movement can result in huge profit.
