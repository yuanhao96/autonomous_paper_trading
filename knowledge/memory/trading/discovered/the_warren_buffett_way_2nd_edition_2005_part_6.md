Chapter 3), Gene Abegg, who was chairman of Illinois National Bank, taught Buffett about the banking business. He learned that banks are profitable businesses as long as loans are issued responsibly and costs are curtailed. A well-managed bank could not only grow its earnings but also earn a handsome return on equity. The key is “well managed.” The long-term value of a bank, as Buffett learned, is determined by the actions of its managers, because they control the two critical variables: costs and loans. Bad managers have a way of running up the costs of operations while making foolish loans; good managers are always looking for ways to cut costs and rarely make risky loans. Carl Reichardt, then chairman of Wells Fargo, had run the bank since 1983, with impressive results. Under his leadership, growth in earnings and return on equity were both above average and operating efficiencies were among the highest in the country. Reichardt had also built a solid loan portfolio. CONSISTENCY Warren Buffett cares very little for stocks that are “hot” at any given moment. He is far more interested in buying into companies that he believes will be successful and profitable for the long term. And while predicting future success is certainly not foolproof, a steady track record is a relatively reliable indicator. When a company has demonstrated 68 T H E W A R R E N B U F F E T T W AY consistent results with the same type of products year after year, it is not unreasonable to assume that those results will continue. As long, that is, as nothing major changes. Buffett avoids purchasing companies that are fundamentally changing direction because their previous plans were unsuccessful. It has been his experience that undergoing major business changes increases the likelihood of committing major business errors. “Severe change and exceptional returns usually don’t mix,” Buffett observes.6 Most individuals, unfortunately, invest as if the opposite were true. Too often, they scramble to purchase stocks of companies that are in the midst of a corporate reorganization. For some unexplained reason, says Buffett, these investors are so infatuated with the notion of what tomorrow may bring that they ignore today’s business reality. In contrast, Buffett says, his approach is “very much profiting from lack of change. That’s the kind of business I like.”7 Buffett also tends to avoid businesses that are solving difficult problems. Experience has taught him that turnarounds seldom turn. It can be more profitable to expend energy purchasing good businesses at reasonable prices than difficult businesses at cheaper prices. “Charlie and I have not learned how to solve difficult business problems,” Buffett admits. “What we have learned is to avoid them. To the extent that we have been successful, it is because we concentrated on identifying one-foot hurdles that we could step over rather than because we acquired any ability to clear seven-footers.”8 The Coca-Cola Company No other company today can match Coca-Cola’s consistent operating history. This is a business that was started in the 1880s selling a beverage product. Today, 120 years later, Coca-Cola is selling the same beverage. Even though the company has periodically invested in unrelated businesses, its core beverage business has remained largely unchanged. The only significant difference today is the company’s size and its geographic reach. One hundred years ago, the company employed ten traveling salesmen to cover the entire United States. At that point, the company was selling 116,492 gallons of syrup a year, for annual sales of $148,000.9 Fifty years later, in 1938, the company was selling 207 million I n v e s t i n g G u i d e l i n e s : B u s i n e s s Te n e t s 69 cases of soft drinks annually (having converted sales from gallons to cases). That year, an article in Fortune noted, “It would be hard to name any company comparable to Coca-Cola and selling, as Coca-Cola does, an unchanged product that can point to a ten year record anything like Coca-Cola’s.”10 Today, nearly seventy years after that article was published, CocaCola is still selling syrup. The only difference is the increase in quantity. By the year 2003, the company was selling over 19 billion cases of soft drink in more than 200 countries, generating $22 billion a year in sales. The Washington Post Company Buffett tells Berkshire’s shareholders that his first financial connection with the Washington Post was at age 13. He delivered both the Washington Post and the Times-Herald on his paper route while his father served in Congress. Buffett likes to remind others that with this dual delivery route he merged the two papers long before Phil Graham bought the Times-Herald. Obviously, Buffett was aware of the newspaper’s rich history. And he considered Newsweek magazine a predictable business. He quickly learned the value of the company’s television stations. The Washington Post had been reporting for years the stellar performance of its broadcast division. Buffett’s personal experience with the company and its own successful history led him to believe that the Washington Post was a consistent and dependable business performer. Gillette Few companies have dominated their industry as long as Gillette. It was the lead brand of razors and blades in 1923 and the lead brand in 2003. Maintaining that position for so many years has required the company to spend hundreds of millions of dollars inventing new, improved products. Even though Wilkinson, in 1962, developed the first coated stainless steel blade, Gillette bounced back quickly and has since worked hard to remain the world’s leading innovator of shaving products. In 1972, Gillette developed the popular twin-blade Trac II; in 1977, the Atra razor with its pivoting head. Then, in 1989, the company developed the 70 T H E W A R R E N B U F F E T T W AY popular Sensor, a razor with independently suspended blades. Gillette’s consistent success is a resul
