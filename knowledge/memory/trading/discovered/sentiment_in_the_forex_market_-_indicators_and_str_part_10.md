Chapter 2 support this claim. Although I lean toward a technician’s point of view, a successful approach to market analysis and trading is not as simple as buying because price is above the moving average or selling because price is below the moving average. Trading is hardly this black and white. A grasp of what is really fundamental to a market’s movement—sentiment—is the key to success in the game of trading and speculation. TOP-DOWN APPROACH The trader must process information (preparation) before making a decision (the trade). There are two approaches to processing information: top-down and bottom-up. When implementing a top-down approach, information regarding the big picture is gathered first. Big picture is the sentiment backdrop as defined by analysis of indicators such as (but not limited to) the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC’s) Commitment of Traders (COT) reports. Does futures positioning indicate that the currency in question is at or is nearing an optimistic or pessimistic extreme? Is the financial media providing any signals? It may sound unconventional (because it is—which is probably why it works), but the financial media often provides exceptionally timely signals. It is just as important to know when a market is not extreme because sometimes the best thing to do is nothing; sit with the trade you have on and ride the trend. There is a time to be a contrarian, but it is less often than most think. Some traders are contrarians just to be contrarians; they are always fighting the trend and never make money. After you feel that you have correctly gauged the psychological state of the market, it is time to assess your risk and time your trade. Knowledge of the market’s structure is essential to this next step.

This is known as the Elliott wave principle, or simply the wave principle. In the 1930s, Ralph Nelson Elliott discovered that crowd behavior will trend and countertrend in recognizable patterns. Although he primarily studied the stock market, the wave principle can be applied to any freely traded market. The size of the FX market makes it a perfect candidate for an analysis technique based on crowd behavior. You will be amazed at the accuracy with which you can gauge support and resistance and forecast direction and the extent of the directional move with knowledge of the wave principle. Traditional technical indicators such as moving averages and oscillators aid in identifying the trend but should be used as secondary tools to sentiment indicators and price patterns. After all, you are trading price, not the indicator. The goal of this book is to provide the tools necessary for developing a top-down, sentiment-based approach to trading and speculation in FX. I refrain from providing specifics such as entries or risk control because these are aspects of trading that everyone will approach differently. REMINISCENCES OF A STOCK OPERATOR If there is one trading book that has had a profound impact on me, then without a doubt that book is Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, written in 1923 by Edwin Lefévre. The fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore (some say that he actually wrote it), one of Wall Street’s all-time great speculators, the story is told through the eyes of the fictional Larry Livingston. (Livermore was the inspiration for Livingston.) Livingston’s experiences and related commentary ring true to the point that it is hard to believe that Livermore himself did not write the book. Regardless of who wrote it, the book is responsible for many of the trading adages that are so common throughout the trading community. When I hit a trading rut, because of bad habits or simply flawed thinking, I always go back to Reminiscences for a reread and it always helps. If you have yet to do so, I strongly recommend reading Reminiscences. I have compiled a few quotes from the book that I believe capture the importance of sentiment in trading and speculation.4 Market Dynamics Are Timeless “Another lesson I learned early is that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can’t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens . . . has happened before and will happen again.” P1: PIC/b c01 P2: c/d QC: e/f JWBK195-Saettele 6 T1: g May 31, 2008 11:15 Printer: Yet to come SENTIMENT IN THE FOREX MARKET “Nowhere does history indulge in repetitions so often or so uniformly as in Wall Street. When you read contemporary accounts of booms or panics the one thing that strikes you most forcibly is how little either speculators or speculation today differ from yesterday. The game does not change and neither does human nature.” Translation: Sentiment has been, is, and always will be fundamental to price in any market. Price patterns that occurred 50 or 100 years ago occur now and will occur in the future. A market price is determined by fear and greed, which is manifested through the activities of the market participants; traders, investors, speculators, and the like. This will never change. Human Nature “But in actual practice a man has to guard against many things, and most of all against himself—that is, against human nature.” “I sometimes think that speculation must be an unnatural sort of business, because I find that the average speculator has arrayed against him his own nature. The weaknesses that all men are prone to are fatal to success in speculation—usually those very weaknesses that make him likable to his fellows or that he himself particularly guards against in those other ventures of his where there are not nearly so dangerous as when he is trading in stocks or commodities.” “The speculator’s chief enemies are always boring from within. It is inseparable from human nature to hope and to fear. In speculation when the market goes against you hope th
