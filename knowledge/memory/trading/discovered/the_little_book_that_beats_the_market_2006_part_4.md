Chapter 1, you’re also beginning to see why all that having to believe stuff is so important. If you don’t believe that the magic formula will work for you, you’ll most likely quit before it has a chance to work! At least, that’s where the statistics over the last 17 years seem to point. The magic formula works— long-term annual returns of double, or in some cases almost triple, the returns of the market averages—only those good returns can get pretty lumpy. Over shorter periods, it may work or it may not. When it comes to the magic formula, “shorter” periods can often mean years, not days or months. In a strange but logical way, that’s the good news. Good news, that is, if you believe enough in the magic formula to stick with it over the long term. But to truly stick with a strategy that hasn’t worked in years and years, you’re going to have to really believe in it deep down in your bones. Sure, the spectacular track record of the magic formula will help, but let’s see what your bones think of the next chapter. Quick Summary 1. The magic formula appears to work very well over the long term. [76] J O E L G R E E N B LAT T 2. The magic formula often doesn’t work for several years in a row. 3. Most investors won’t (or can’t) stick with a strategy that hasn’t worked for several years in a row. 4. For the magic formula to work for you, you must believe that it will work and maintain a long-term investment horizon. 5. If it wasn’t for this chapter, the next chapter would be the most important chapter in the book. Chapter Nine “VOMIT UNDER THE 3EM-SPACES AND RUN!” Now there’s a saying you don’t hear every day. The main reason you don’t hear it much is pretty straightforward. Over time, the phrase has lost all of its meaning. In fact, I really only needed it to pass my eighth-grade course in print shop. You see, old-time printers used to set type by hand and actually picked letters individually out of a box. To pass the course, my fellow middle schoolers and I were forced to memorize the location of these letters. The letters in the bottom row were V-U-T, then something called a 3em-space, followed by the letters A-R. We remembered [78] J O E L G R E E N B LAT T the order by the catchy phrase “Vomit under the 3emspaces and run!” With the advent of computers, my little memory device—and print shop, for that matter—is now useless. Of course, the world has changed a lot since I was in middle school. No one teaches print shop anymore. Thankfully, though, some subjects haven’t changed. Math class, for one, is still pretty much the same. As investors, that’s really important to know. That’s because, in order for the magic formula to make us money in the long run, the principles behind it must appear not only sensible and logical, but timeless. Otherwise, there is no way we’ll be able to “hang on” when our short-term results turn against us. As simple as it may seem, knowing that two plus two always equals four can be a pretty powerful concept. No matter how many people tell us differently, no matter how long they tell us, and no matter how smart all those people appear to be, we are unlikely to waver in our conviction. In a similar way, our level of confidence in the magic formula will determine whether we can hang on to a strategy that may be both unpopular and unsuccessful for seemingly long periods of time. So what is it about the magic formula that makes sense—so much sense, in fact, that we won’t waver when things turn against us? Well, let’s take another look. T H E L I T T L E B O O K T H AT B E ATS T H E M A R K E T [79] The magic formula chooses companies through a ranking system. Those companies that have both a high return on capital and a high earnings yield are the ones that the formula ranks as best. Put more simply, the formula is systematically helping us find above-average companies that we can buy at below-average prices. That certainly sounds logical and sensible. If, indeed, that’s what we’re really doing, it also sounds like a strategy we can truly believe in. So, let’s go step-by-step and see whether that’s true. First, why are companies that earn a high return on capital so special? What kind of companies is our formula telling us to buy? What makes them above average? To understand the answers to those questions, let’s go back and check in with our old friend Jason. Last year, as you may remember, was a pretty good year for Jason’s business. Each of his gum shops earned $200,000. Since he only had to invest $400,000 to build each store (including inventory, store displays, etc.), that meant that his return on capital for opening a gum shop was a pretty impressive 50 percent ($200,000 divided by $400,000). So what does that mean? Most people and most businesses can’t find an investment that will earn a 50 percent annual return. If the past year is a good guideline and Jason’s company can really earn 50 percent a year on its money by simply opening another [80] J O E L G R E E N B LAT T store, that makes Jason’s Gum Shops a pretty special business. Think about that. Having the opportunity to invest your money and earn 50 percent per year is pretty rare. While it’s true that there is no guarantee that Jason’s new stores (or his old stores) will continue to earn 50 percent returns each year on their original cost, last year’s high returns may be a good indicator of the opportunity to earn high returns from investing in that same business going forward. If that’s true and Jason’s Gum Shops can continue to earn high returns from its investments in old and new stores, that’s really good news for Jason. First, that may mean that the profits from Jason’s business don’t have to just sit there. While Jason’s Gum Shops could take those earnings and invest in a government bond paying 6 percent per year, they have a much better option. The company can take those earnings and invest them in a new store. So not only will the original investment in the first store continue to earn 50 percent p
