new trend. All we have to do, is follow the insiders, and buy and sell, when they are buying and selling. In this chapter you will discover how to see this for yourself in any market. Chapter Six : Volume Price Analysis - The Next Level Here we start to build on the concepts from the previous chapter and begin to look at VPA in action using the three most powerful candles. In addition I explain stopping volume and topping out volume, as we start to build our VPA knowledge into a complete approach to market analysis. Chapter Seven : Support And Resistance Explained Support and resistance is one of the cornerstones of technical trading. Yet when combined with volume, this essential technique becomes even more powerful. Few traders ever discover how to identify when the markets are moving into a congestion phase, or equally important to validate when they are breaking out. In this chapter you will discover both! Chapter Eight : Dynamic Trends And Trend Lines Forget traditional trend and trend lines. By the time these are developed you are just getting in when the smart money is getting out! In this chapter you will learn how to create dynamic trend lines, which when coupled with VPA get you in at the start of the trend, and NOT at the end. If you have ever struggled with the concept of traditional trend theory, this is for you and will revolutionize your trading. Chapter Nine : Volume At Price (VAP) Volume Price Analysis or VPA is one thing. Volume at price of VAP is something entirely different, and which gives you a visual and instant picture of the density of volumes at price levels on the chart. This is so powerful, it’s amazing more traders don’t use this approach. After all, a breakout from one of these regions means one thing - a new trend! And when confirmed with VPA - money! Chapter Ten : Volume Price Analysis Examples Here we examine some ‘worked’ examples across various markets in detail. See VPA applied to stocks in the cash markets, currencies in the spot FX market, indices in the futures markets and commodities using tick charts. In fact virtually every market and type of chart from tick to time based charts, all detailed and annotated for you. If you still need to be convinced, I hope this chapter will do it for you! Chapter Eleven : Putting It All Together Now it’s time to pull all the elements together. In addition I explain some of the most powerful congestion patterns which have worked consistently over 16 years of trading, and when combined with volume, give us simple and clear trading opportunities - provided you can be patient! Chapter Twelve : Volume And Price - The Next Generation In the final chapter I introduce some of the latest developments in Volume Price Analysis, and where this methodology may go in the future. Charles Dow and the other iconic traders of the past would love these extensions of their original work.
