Chapter 4, it is Mr. Market’s constantly changing emotional state that creates the bargain opportunities that the magic formula is able to put to its advantage. But these same emotions create a problem. If Mr. Market is so unstable, how can we be sure that he will eventually pay a fair price for our bargain purchases? If we don’t eventually get a fair price from Mr. Market, a bargain could remain a bargain forever (or worse, become even more of a bargain!). So here’s the other thing you need to know about Mr. Market: • Over the short term, Mr. Market acts like a wildly emotional guy who can buy or sell stocks at depressed or inflated prices. • Over the long run, it’s a completely different story: Mr. Market gets it right. Yep. Over the long term, crazy Mr. Market is actually a very rational fellow. It may take a few weeks or a few months, and not infrequently a few years, but eventually [96] J O E L G R E E N B LAT T Mr. Market will pay a fair price for our shares. I actually give a guarantee to my MBA students at the beginning of each semester. I guarantee them that if they do a good job valuing a company, Mr. Market will eventually agree with them. I tell them that, though it can occasionally take longer, if their analysis is correct, two to three years is usually all the time they’ll have to wait for Mr. Market to reward their bargain purchases with a fair price. How can this be? Isn’t Mr. Market an emotional basket case? Well, although it’s true that Mr. Market can often be ruled by emotion over the short term, over time facts and reality take over. If the price of a stock has been beaten down unfairly in the short term by an overly emotional Mr. Market (this could happen, for instance, when a company announces some bad news or is expected to receive some bad news in the near future), a few things can take place. First, there are a lot of smart people out there. If the price offered by Mr. Market is truly a bargain, some of these smart people will eventually recognize the bargain opportunity, buy stock, and push the price closer to fair value. This doesn’t have to happen right away. Sometimes uncertainty about the prospects for a particular company over the near term will keep potential buyers away. Sometimes the influence of emotions can last for years. But here’s the thing. Eventually, the problem or the reason for T H E L I T T L E B O O K T H AT B E ATS T H E M A R K E T [97] the emotional reaction is resolved. It could be a positive resolution or a negative one. It doesn’t really matter. If there is uncertainty about a company’s earnings over the next two or three years, by waiting long enough we eventually find out the answer (even if this takes the full two or three years!). Once the reality of the situation is known, smart investors will buy stock if the bargain opportunity still exists. Second, even if these so-called “smart” people don’t recognize the bargain opportunity and buy shares, there are other ways that stock prices can move toward fair value. Often companies buy back their own shares. If a company believes its shares are undervalued, the management of the company can decide that it is a good investment to use its own cash and repurchase some of the company’s shares.* So this action of companies buying back their own shares is another activity that causes prices to rise and may help eliminate some bargain opportunities. If that doesn’t work, there are still other ways that share prices tend to move toward fair value. Remember, a share of stock represents an ownership interest in an actual company. Anyone who buys all of the shares *This would reduce the amount of cash the company had, but it would also reduce the number of shares outstanding of the company. If ownership of the company is distributed among fewer shares, each remaining shareholder would own a larger percentage interest in the company. [98] J O E L G R E E N B LAT T outstanding would then own the entire company. Often, if a bargain opportunity persists for too long, another company or a large investment firm may decide to make a bid for all of the shares outstanding and purchase the entire company. Sometimes even the possibility that a buyer for the whole company may emerge can cause share prices to rise toward fair value. In short, over time the interaction of all of these things—smart investors searching for bargain opportunities, companies buying back their own shares, and the takeover or possibility of a takeover of an entire company—work together to move share prices toward fair value. Sometimes this process works quickly, and sometimes it can take several years. Although over the short term, Mr. Market may set stock prices based on emotion, over the long term, it is the value of the company that becomes most important to Mr. Market. This means that if you buy shares at what you believe to be a bargain price and you are right, Mr. Market will eventually agree and offer to buy those shares at a fair price. In other words, bargain purchases will be rewarded. Though the process doesn’t always work quickly, two to three years is usually enough time for Mr. Market to get things right. So now that we have all that good news out of the way, let’s see if we can sail through the next chapter without hitting anything. T H E L I T T L E B O O K T H AT B E ATS T H E M A R K E T [99] Quick Summary 1. The magic formula works. It works even better than I let on before. 2. The magic formula achieved its far superior results with far less risk than the market averages. 3. Although over the short term Mr. Market may price stocks based on emotion, over the long term Mr. Market prices stocks based on their value. 4. If you couldn’t vomit under the 3em-spaces, try sailing with me. Chapter Eleven SO THE MAGIC FORMULA ISN’T YOUR THING. The high returns, the low risk, the simplicity, the logic—these things mean nothing to you. You want—in fact, you need—to pick stocks all by yourself! No one, and especially no silly for
