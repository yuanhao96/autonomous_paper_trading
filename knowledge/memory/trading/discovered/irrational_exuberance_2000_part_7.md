Chapter 10 for a further discussion of public attitudes toward mutual funds.) The Decline of Inflation and the Effects of Money Illusion The outlook for U.S. inﬂation, as measured by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index, has gradually improved since the bull market began. In 1982, even though U.S. inﬂation was then P RE CIP ITATIN G FACTO RS 37 around 4% a year, there was still considerable uncertainty as to whether it would return to the high level (nearly 15% for the year) experienced in 1980. The most dramatic stock price increases of this bull market occurred once the inﬂation rate had settled down into the 2–3% range in the mid-1990s, and it then dropped below 2%. The general public pays a lot of attention to inﬂation, as I discovered in my interview studies of public attitudes toward it.28 People widely believe that the inﬂation rate is a barometer of the economic and social health of a nation. High inﬂation is perceived as a sign of economic disarray, of a loss of basic values, and a disgrace to the nation, an embarrassment before foreigners. Low inﬂation is viewed as a sign of economic prosperity, social justice, and good government. It is not surprising, therefore, that a lower inﬂation rate boosts public conﬁdence, hence stock market valuation. But from a purely rational standpoint, this stock market reaction to inﬂation is inappropriate. In 1979 Nobel laureate Franco Modigliani, with Richard Cohn, published an article arguing that the stock market reacts inappropriately to inﬂation because people do not fully understand the effect of inﬂation on interest rates.29 When inﬂation is high—as it was when they wrote, near the bottom of the stock market in 1982—nominal interest rates (the usual interest rates we see quoted every day) are high because they must compensate investors for the inﬂation that is eroding the value of their dollars. Yet real interest rates (interest rates as corrected for the effects of inﬂation) were not high then, and therefore there should not have been any stock market reaction to the high nominal rates. Modigliani and Cohn suggested that the market tends to be depressed when nominal rates are high even when real rates are not high because of a sort of “money illusion,” or public confusion about the effects of a changing monetary standard. When there is inﬂation, we are changing the value of the dollar, and therefore changing the yardstick by which we measure values. Faced with a changing yardstick, it is not surprising that many people become confused. Modigliani and Cohn also argued (and this is a more subtle point) that people fail to take account of a bias in measured corporate profits due to the fact that corporations deduct from their proﬁts the 38 STR UC TUR AL FAC TOR S total interest paid on their debt, and not just the real (inﬂationcorrected) interest. In inﬂationary times, part of this interest paid may be viewed merely as a prepayment of part of the real debt, rather than a cost to the company. Few investors realize this and make corrections for this effect of inﬂation. Their failure to do so may be described as another example of money illusion.30 Public misunderstanding about inﬂation at the present time encourages high expectations for real (inﬂation-corrected) returns. Most data on past long-run stock market returns is reported in the media in nominal terms, without correction for inﬂation, and people might naturally be encouraged to expect that such nominal returns would continue in the future. Inﬂation today is under 2%, compared with a historical average Consumer Price Index level of inﬂation that has averaged 4.4% a year since John Kennedy was elected president in 1960. Therefore expecting the same nominal returns we have seen in the stock market since 1960 is expecting a lot more in real terms. Plots of historical stock price indexes in the media are almost invariably shown in nominal terms, not the real inﬂation-corrected terms shown in the ﬁgures in this book. Consumer prices have increased six-fold since 1960 and seventeen-fold since 1913. This inﬂation imparts an strong upward trend to long-run historical plots of stock price indexes, if they are not corrected for inﬂation. Thus the extraordinary behavior of the real stock market at the turn of the millennium, the spike up in stock prices that was visible in Figure 1.1, does not stand out in the long historical plots we see in the media. In fact, viewing these plots encourages us to think that nothing at all unusual is going on now in the stock market. The reason news writers generally do not make corrections for inﬂation is probably that they think such adjustments are esoteric and would not be widely appreciated by their readers. And they are probably right. The general public has not by and large taken Economics 101, and those who did sit through it have probably forgotten much of what they learned. Thus they have not assimilated the basic lesson that there is nothing natural about measuring prices in dollars when the quantity, and value, of those dollars has P RE CIP ITATIN G FACTO RS 39 been highly unstable. The public at large does not fully appreciate that the more meaningful measure of the stock market level is in terms of some broad basket of goods, as the level is measured if it is corrected for consumer price inﬂation.31 Expansion of the Volume of Trade: Discount Brokers, Day Traders, and Twenty-Four-Hour Trading The turnover rate (the total shares sold in a year divided by the total number of shares) for New York Stock Exchange stocks nearly doubled between 1982 and 1999, from 42% to 78%.32 The NASDAQ market, which emphasizes high-technolgoy stocks, shows an even greater turnover rate increase, from 88% in 1990 to 221% in 1999.33 The higher turnover rate may be symptomatic of increased interest in the market as a result of other factors mentioned here. But another reason for the rising turnover rate in the stock market is the declining cost of making a tr
