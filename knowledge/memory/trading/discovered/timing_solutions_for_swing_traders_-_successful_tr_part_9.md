Chapter 9, in the section called “Using Lunar Cycles in Trading,” details how a lunar-phased buy-sell strategy will produce returns which substantially exceed those of a buy-hold strategy only over several years. That said, for those who are actively trading the markets, it should be emphasized that the intention is not to trade on the basis of moon-phased buy-sell signals only, but if, for instance, the new moon correlates with a buy signal from a momentum system like stochastics and moving average crossovers, then it lends strength to that signal. Conversely, if the full moon correlates with a technical sell signal, it would add strength to that signal. Unless the signals are in harmony, it may be better to limit trading or stay on the sideline. Another combination is to plot the solar and lunar eclipse points, as they quite often coincide with CITs. The eclipses have a much more intense focus than the regular lunar phases. When the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, the sunlight is blocked either partially or fully. It is called a solar eclipse and happens at the new moon. The full moon eclipse is called a lunar eclipse. This happens when the Earth gets between the Sun and the Moon, and the Earth’s shadow falls on the Moon. The effect of a solar eclipse is usually stronger than a lunar eclipse. However, the duration of the lunar eclipse on June 15, 2011, was 100 minutes, which is unusually long; only three other eclipses lasted longer in the last 100 years. The long duration is likely to strengthen the effect so instead of weeks it may last for months and when a transiting planet aspects the lunation point, it can trigger sudden wide price swings. In Figure 2.8 , the black lines reflect solar eclipses and the blue lines show lunar eclipses. They are plotted here on a weekly chart of the Hang Seng Index but may apply to any market. The correlation with CITs is quite high, so one would always want to remain on alert well ahead of time for the next eclipses, such as the ones that took place on November 25 and December 10, 2011. FIGURE 2.8 Lunar eclipses and solar eclipses, plotted here on a weekly chart of the Hang Seng Index. Furthermore, a little-known but valuable technique is to show projections 90 days before and 90 days after an eclipse, marked with dotted lines. These projections often coincide with important turning points in some markets. Certainly, in the case of the Hang Seng Index, they correlate very well with CITs. With these projections, as shown by the dotted lines in September 2011 (see Figure 2.8 ), one can always be prepared for a possible major change in trend. The next chart shows how a market often moves in alignment or within the boundaries of planetary positions, whether geocentric (as seen from the Earth) or heliocentric (as seen from the Sun). The effect of the planets is dealt with in greater detail in
