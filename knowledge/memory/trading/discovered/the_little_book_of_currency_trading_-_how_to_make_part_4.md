Chapter 6 talked about how investing in the forex market is slightly different from investing in the stock market. The high amount of leverage available to forex traders magnifies profits and losses, which is why the holding period of currency investments tends to be shorter than that of equity investments. In this chapter, we will talk about different ways to join moves that last for weeks. One of the most memorable moments in my career was when John Bollinger, the mastermind and namesake behind Bollinger Bands, stood behind a crowd and watched me show traders in Singapore the Double Bollinger Bands. He said to one of my colleagues that it was a “clever way to use the bands.” Of the hundreds of technical indicators out there, the Double Bollinger Bands are hands down my favorite. Through the years, the bands have become a critical component of my trading. The reason I really love the Double Bollinger Bands (BB bands for short) is they provide a wealth of actionable information. They tell me whether a currency pair is in trend or range, the direction of the trend, and when the trend has exhausted. More importantly, Bollinger Bands also identify entry points and proper places to put a stop. Bollinger Band Basics Before describing how the Double Bollinger Bands work, it is important to first explain them. Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—a 20-period moving average, which is the center line and then the upper and lower lines, which are basically a specific standard deviation away from the moving average. Just imagine a two-lane highway with a center divider that is the moving average and barriers on either side, which are the standard deviations. The default Bollinger Band parameters on most charting packages are 20 periods and two standard deviations. Although understanding the math behind how the bands are created may be complicated for some, the way they are used is more important and simple to grasp. The purpose of the bands is to determine how high or low a currency pair has moved in relation to the average price over the past 20 periods. Two standard deviations is considered quite rare because in Statistics 101, it is said that 95 percent of all activity should fall within two standard deviations of the average and only 5 percent should fall outside of that amount. Applying this to currencies means that when the currency pair reaches the second standard deviation band, the move has hit an extreme point because the idea is that 95 percent of the time the currency pair trades between the bands. However, the problem with this notion is that a quick look at currency charts overlaid with Bollinger Bands will show that reaching the extremes happens more often than we would think. We know that currencies can move in one direction for a long period of time and there will be times when it may touch the Bollinger Band five days in a row, making a rare event a common occasion. This is why we devised the Double Bollinger Band Method, which we have found to be a much better use of Bollinger’s creation. The Double Bollinger Band Method consists of using two sets of Bollinger Bands. In addition to the second standard deviation Bollinger Band just mentioned, we also use a first deviation Bollinger Band. The centerlines (or medians) are excluded because otherwise the charts become very messy and crowded. Exhibit 8.1 shows how the Bollinger Bands would look on a daily chart of USD/JPY. The two outside lines are the second standard deviation Bollinger Bands and the two inside lines are the first standard deviation Bollinger Bands. Once the Double Bollinger Bands are set up, they can be used for identifying whether the currency is in a range or trend, if and when a trend has exhausted, where to find value within the trend, and how to get into a new trend. Exhibit 8.1 Using Double Bollinger Bands with USD/JPY Source: GFT Dealbook 360. The most important thing that the Double Bollinger Bands do is answer the $500 million question of whether the currency pair is in trend or range. When a trend is very strong, most of the currency pair’s price action will be confined within the one and two standard deviation Bollinger Bands. The Double Bollinger Bands also determine the direction of the trend. The two bands at the lower part of the chart capture the downtrend while the two bands at the upper part of the chart capture the uptrend. In other words, if the USD/JPY was trading between the upper one and two standard deviation bands, it is in an uptrend, and if it was trading between the two lower bands, it is in a downtrend. Usually when the currency pair is in trend, it will not end the day outside of the first and second bands unless the trend is exhausting. When the trend is weak, the price action will be confined within the first standard deviation bands (the two centerlines) in the range-trading zone. If all four bands are very close together, we can see with the naked eye that the currency is range trading. Only when the bands are moving away from each other or are far apart already will the trend indicators be useful. For example, the right side of the USD/JPY chart in Exhibit 8.1 shows that during the move from 90 to 87, USD/JPY never traded above the downtrend zone. The uptrend, downtrend, and range zones are all marked on the chart. Knowing When the Trend Has Exhausted When the currency pair moves outside the up- or downtrend zone and into the range-trading zone, it signals that the trend has exhausted. For bottom-fishers and top pickers, the Bollinger Bands can be an easy-to-understand and useful tool. Rather than blindly picking a top or bottom because the price looked expensive or cheap, the Bollinger Bands can be used to identify when a trend could be over. Take another look at the USD/JPY chart in Exhibit 8.1. You may notice that when USD/JPY falls out of the uptrend zone, the move will frequently extend to the lower first standard deviation Bollinger Band. In contrast, if USD/JPY rises out o
