Chapter 11, if it is difficult to short the market, then a basic premise of the efficient markets theory is not met. The so-called “smart money” can stop investing in homes altogether, but afterward will not be able to take actions to stop others from bidding prices even further up and up. Any large group of investors, from anywhere in the world, for example, could bid local home prices up to crazy levels if they get the idea to do so, or any large institutional investors, playing some kind of game, could do so too. There is no reputable theory to say that, in the absence of the possibility of short sales, they cannot. Many have tried to make such short sales for single-family homes possible, so far with little success. In the past few years, some high-tech institutional players, such as the Blackstone Group, have begun to invest in single-family homes, and the presence of these players might tend to alter the dynamics of home price bubbles, reducing month-to-month momentum in these markets. But high short-term momentum in home prices, as well as the longer-term real estate bubbles, are surely still with us. The word bubble creates a mental picture of an expanding soap bubble, which is destined to pop suddenly and irrevocably. But speculative bubbles are not so easily ended; indeed, they may deflate somewhat, as the story changes, and then reflate. It would seem more accurate to refer to these episodes as speculative epidemics. We know that a new epidemic can suddenly appear just as an older one is fading if a new form of the virus appears, or if some environmental factor increases the contagion rate. Similarly, a new speculative bubble can appear anywhere if a new story about the economy appears and if it has enough narrative strength to spark a new contagion of investor thinking. This is what happened in the bull market of the 1920s in the United States, with its peak in 1929. We have distorted that history by thinking of bubbles as a period of dramatic price growth, followed by a sudden turning point and a major and definitive crash. In fact, a major boom in real stock prices in the United States after “Black Tuesday” brought them halfway back to 1929 levels by 1930. This was followed by a second crash, another boom from 1932 to 1937, and a third crash. Since the second edition of this book, there has been much discussion of the price-earnings ratio that John Campbell of Harvard University and I had developed and that this book featured from its first edition: real price divided by the ten-year average of real earnings. The press has seemed to adopt the name I had sometimes given it, the CAPE (for Cyclically Adjusted xvi PR EFAC E T O T HE T HIR D EDIT ION Price-Earnings ratio), so now I regularly call it that, too. This ratio has appeared as the third figure of the first chapter of this book in all editions, though the name “CAPE” did not appear in the earlier editions of this book. The ratio may be regarded as adjusting the usual price-earnings ratio, which is based on one-year earnings, for the business cycle, correcting for the sudden spikes in the price-earnings ratio that occur after business recessions when earnings may be very low, by averaging earnings over a long period of time. As of this writing, the CAPE for the United States stands at 26, higher than ever before except for the times around 1929, 2000, and 2007, all major market peaks. But this book is not primarily about the current situation in asset markets but about getting a sense of reality about the nature and dynamics of these markets. The current edition of this book is partly motivated by work I did with George Akerlof for our 2009 book Animal Spirits, a book whose title correctly suggests some overlap of topics with Irrational Exuberance. The ancient term “animal spirits” (in Latin, spiritus animalis) refers to the fluctuations in the basic driving force in human actions; it is a term that was resurrected by the economist John Maynard Keynes, who gives a view of the economy as involving fundamental psychological instabilities. Both fluctuations in irrational exuberance and animal spirits are still very much a part of our lives. We must still summon our whole arsenal of social sciences to try to understand them. Outline of This Book Reproduced here are the Prefaces for the 2005 and 2000 editions of the book, to give a sense how this book has evolved over the financial ups and downs. The 2005 Preface was issued just before the peak of the Ownership-Society Bubble. The 2000 Preface appeared with the first edition, just as the market was reaching the peak of the Millennium Bubble. The book proper begins with three introductory chapters that place in historical context the ups and downs of the three major markets for investors: the stock market, the bond market, and the real estate market.
