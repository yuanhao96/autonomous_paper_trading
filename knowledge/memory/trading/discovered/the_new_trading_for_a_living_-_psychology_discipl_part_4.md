Section 4). It occurs when prices reach a new high but the indicator reaches a lower high than it did on the previous rally. Bearish divergences mark the ends of uptrends and some of the best shorting opportunities. When the trend is down, bears feel like good children, praised and rewarded for being smart. They feel increasingly confident, add to short positions, and the downtrend continues. New bears come into the market. People admire winners, and the financial media keeps interviewing bears during bear markets. Bulls lose money in downtrends, making them feel bad. They start dumping their positions, and some of them switch sides to join bears. Their selling pushes markets lower. After a while, bears grow confident and bulls feel demoralized. Suddenly, a price shock occurs. A cluster of buy orders soaks up all available sell orders and lifts the market. Now bears feel like children whose father has lashed out at them in the midst of a happy meal. A price shock plants the seeds of a downtrend’s eventual reversal because bears become more fearful and bulls grow bolder. When a child begins to doubt that Santa Claus exists, he’ll seldom believe in Santa again. Even if bears recover and prices fall to a new low, several technical indicators will help identify their weakness by tracing a pattern called a bullish divergence. It occurs when prices fall to a new low but an indicator traces a shallower bottom than during the previous decline. Bullish divergences identify some of the best buying opportunities. Social Psychology Free will makes individual behavior hard to predict. Group behavior is more primitive and easier to track. When you analyze markets, you analyze group behavior. 46 MASS PSYCHOLOGY You need to identify the direction in which groups are running and their changes of speed. Groups suck us in and cloud our judgment. The problem for most analysts is that they get caught in the emotional pull of the groups they try to analyze. The longer a rally continues, the more analysts get caught up in mass bullishness, ignore danger signs, and miss the eventual reversal. The longer a decline goes on, the more analysts get caught up in bearish gloom and ignore bullish signs. This is why it helps to have a written plan for analyzing markets.We have to decide in advance what indicators we will watch, how we will interpret them, and how we’ll act. Professionals use several tools for tracking the intensity of the crowd’s feelings. They watch the crowd’s ability to break through recent support and resistance levels. Floor traders used to listen to the changes in pitch and volume of the roar on the exchange floor. With floor trading rapidly receding into history, you’ll need special tools for analyzing crowd behavior. Fortunately, your charts and indicators reflect mass psychology in action. A technical analyst is an applied social psychologist, usually armed with a computer. ■■16. Managing versus Forecasting I once ran into a very fat surgeon at a seminar. He told me that he had lost a quarter of a million dollars in three years trading stocks and options. When I asked him how he made his trading decisions, he sheepishly pointed to his ample gut. He gambled on hunches and used his professional income to support his habit. There are two alternatives to “gut feel”: One is fundamental analysis; the other is technical analysis. Fundamental analysts study the actions of the Federal Reserve, follow earnings reports, examine crop reports, and so on. Major bull and bear markets reflect fundamental changes in supply and demand. Still, even if you know those factors, you can lose money trading if you are out of touch with intermediate- and short-term trends, which depend on the crowd’s emotions. Technical analysts believe that prices reflect everything known about the market, including fundamental factors. Each price represents the consensus of value of all market participants—large commercial interests and small speculators, fundamental researchers and technicians, insiders and gamblers. Technical analysis is a study of mass psychology. It is partly a science and partly an art. Technicians use many scientific methods, including mathematical concepts of game theory, probabilities, and so on. They use computers to track indicators. Technical analysis is also an art. The bars or candles on our charts coalesce into patterns and formations. The movement of prices and indicators produces a sense of flow and rhythm, a feeling of tension and beauty that helps us sense what is happening and how to trade. Individual behavior is complex, diverse, and difficult to predict. Group behavior is primitive. Technicians study the behavior patterns of market crowds. They trade when they recognize patterns that preceded previous market moves. Get More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com 16. MANAGING VERSUS FORECASTING 47 Poll-Taking Politicians want to know their chances of being elected or re-elected. They make promises to voters and have poll-takers measure a crowd’s response. Technical analysis is similar to political poll-taking, as both aim to read the intentions of masses. Poll-takers do it to help their clients win elections, while technicians do it for financial gain. Poll-takers use scientific methods: statistics, sampling procedures, and so on.They also need a flair for interviewing and phrasing questions; they have to be plugged into the emotional undercurrents of their party. Poll-taking is a combination of science and art. If a poll-taker says he is a scientist, ask him why every major political polltaker in the United States is affiliated with either the Democratic or Republican party. True science knows no party. A market technician must rise above party affiliation. Be neither a bull nor a bear, but only seek the truth. A biased bull looks at a chart and says, “Where can I buy?” A biased bear looks at the same chart and tries to find where he can go short. A topflight analyst is free of bullish or
