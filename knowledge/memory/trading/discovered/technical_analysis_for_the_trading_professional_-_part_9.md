Chapter 10, so let's not stray from tor will now focus on one of the largest markets in the world: it is ready to reverse its former trend. An actual price projection Our discussion about trend reversals using the RSI indica- ket decline will move the RSI to the support zone near 40 only if rally that follows will likely be insufficient to press the RSI through the upper resistance range defined for a bear market. The failed attempt to exceed 65 will be met with another price decline that [XU5DMMUI -Weekly ixviIvS moves the RSI oscillator back to support within the 40 to 50 range once again. Should the market produce an RSI oscillator decline that successfully holds the 40 to 50 support zone a second time, it should be interpreted as a clear warning to a sleeping bear-biased trader that conditions are changing. The market is attempting to reverse and will eventually produce a price rally from this oscillator position that is strong enough to press the RSI into the upper resistance range reserved for a bull market—75 to 85 and higher. It is not necessary for a market to test the new lower boundary more than once before successfully breaking out into the higher range, but it is a common occurrence to see double bottoms develop, especially in longer horizon charts such as weekly, monthly, and quarterly time 6 Figure 1.5 A e r o d y n a m i c i n v e s t m e n t s Inc., © 1 9 9 6 - 2 0 1 1 , www.aeroinvest.com 14 • DISPELLING SOME COMMON BELIEFS ABOUT INDICATORS Oscillators Do Not Travel between 0 and 100 * 15 bear market. the RSI in Figure 1.5: 30 level, which is normal support for this indicator in a addresses each of the oscillator pivot levels that are numbered on Point 4.
