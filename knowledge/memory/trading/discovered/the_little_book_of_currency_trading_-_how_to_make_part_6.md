Chapter 9), we only traded the majors, but that may not always be the best option. For example, there are many cases where U.S. and Canadian economic data are released at the same time. If the Canadian data is very weak, one would assume that the best currency pair to buy after the news is released is USD/CAD. This is true if the U.S. economic data is stronger than expected, but if it is weak, then the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar could both decline, leading to no major continuation in USD/CAD. In that case, it may be better to consider expressing the Canadian news trade through another currency pair such as AUD/CAD or CAD/JPY, which will be less affected by the U.S. economic data. The same is true if you have a good piece of European data but the market is bullish toward the dollar for one reason or another. Then perhaps buying euros against the pound is the higher probability trade. These are judgment calls that short-term traders must make at the time of the trade, and they are important because they can mean the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful trade. It’s worth the extra minute you’ll take before diving into a trade. The Key Is Yours You can never be 100 percent certain about whether a trade will be successful or not, but you can increase the probability of it being successful by looking for only high-quality trades. This extra effort is important if you value your hard-earned money (and I think you should!). I am a big believer in high-probability trading and the questions in this chapter are the ones that I ask myself before every single trade. The point is to have as many stars aligned in your favor as possible on your trades and not to expose it to unnecessary and amateur risks. Trading will always be risky business, but making sure the fundamentals, technicals, and market sentiment support your trade every time will give you the highest probability of success. The keys to successful trading are to have an edge, minimize the risks, and not be greedy! Get It? Got It? Good! Shallow retracements are a sign of higher probability trades. A trend is more likely to continue if there is no fundamental reason for the dip. Seek out trades that are supported by upcoming economic data. Trades that are in line with the general sentiment in the market are a better choice. Make sure key levels will not stall the trade. Short-term traders should know what time of day is suitable for their trading strategy and to pick the right currency pairs. Chapter Eleven The Top 10 Mistakes . . . So You Don’t Make Them In 2009, George Clooney starred in the Oscar-nominated film Up in the Air, a story about a corporate executioner who spends 322 days out of the year on the road. His character, Ryan Bingham, is an efficiency expert who knows all the shortcuts to get through security checkpoints swiftly so he can spend the shortest amount of time waiting for his plane. I may not fly nearly as much as Bingham, but when I do, I like to test cutoff times and arrive at the airport minutes before my flight boards. My tendency to wait until the 11th hour before arriving at the airport drives my coworkers, friends, and family nuts. Most people I know get to the airport one and a half hours before a domestic flight and three hours before an international flight. Yes, these are the Transportation Security Administration’s recommendations, but they are designed for the casual traveler and not the Ryan Binghams of the world. Like Bingham, I always check in online, print out my boarding pass, make sure there are no liquids, aerosols, or gels in my carry-on luggage, and know that my frequent flier elite status allows me to bypass long security lines. For domestic flights, I usually arrive at the airport no more than 45 minutes before boarding and for international flights no more than 90 minutes. Have I ever missed a flight? Only once when I was headed to Italy for vacation. Did I learn from my mistake? Nope, because in the 10 years and hundreds of flights since then, I have never missed another flight—and it was not because I started to arrive at the airport earlier. Should most people do as I do? Probably not. The main reason I wait until the last minute to head to the airport is that I can squeeze in a few extra hours of sleep or an extra hour of work, and the worst that can happen is I will get bumped onto the next flight. I factor in the worst-case scenario before every flight and know that it can be handled with a phone call and some patience. However, not everyone can afford to miss their flight because of connections or appointments. The same goes for trading—not everyone can afford to make a ton of mistakes. Part of trading is about managing the trade and part of it is about managing ourselves. We all have our own level of risk tolerance, but having met thousands of successful and unsuccessful forex traders, I can tell you that most forex traders make the same mistakes. In general, human emotions can kill profits. Some traders become so frustrated that they decide to codify their trading rules, which basically lets the computer do all of the work and eliminates human intervention. However, computers can’t adjust to changing market environments. Most of the mistakes that traders make are not new; for those people who are able to avoid them from the very beginning, the path to successful trading will be smoother. Whether you’re new to forex trading or have made some mistakes already, review this list of Top 10 Mistakes of Forex Traders and hopefully, it will save you a lot of time and money. Mistake #1: Trading Out of Boredom or Anger. The trader’s high never goes away. Regardless of whether you have been trading for a month, a year, or a decade, there is always an initial adrenaline rush when you put on the trade. However, being bored and seeking excitement is one of the worst reasons to trade. When the markets are quiet and you are looking to put on a position, there is a very good chance
