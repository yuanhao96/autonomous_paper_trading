Chapter 1. But these examples of persistent bad performance in the stock market are not prominent in the public mind. One reason that the recent domestic market performance is more prominent in investors’ minds is simply that they have experienced these domestic stock prices every day; they have watched and reacted to a rising U.S. market since 1982. U.S. investors today have not had the same experience with Japanese stocks, or with the U.S. market in decades past. Many people ﬁx their attention on plots of rising stock prices in newspapers every day, and they seem to come away with an intuitive feeling that every decline is reversed, to be followed swiftly by new highs. The same human pattern-recognition faculty that we used when we learned to ride a bike or to drive a car, giving us an intuitive sense of what to expect next, has been applied to our expectations for the market. For investors in their twenties, thirties, or forties, this upward trend has been present during most of the years they have been observing or investing in the market. The subjective experience over the years of seeing stock market declines consistently reverse themselves has a psychological impact on our thinking that is hard to appreciate, or reconstruct, after the fact. Those who thought the market would go down and stay down became sensitized to their bad feelings from being repeatedly wrong, year after year. Those who consistently predicted a decline became painfully aware of a loss of reputation from being so wrong so often. Since our satisfaction with our views of the world is part of our self-esteem and personal identity, it is natural for the for- AMP L IF ICATIO N ME CH ANISMS 49 merly pessimistic to want to settle on a different view, or at least to present themselves to the public with a different theme. Thus the changed emotional environment will have an impact on their views—or certainly the expression of them—that is independent of any objective evidence supporting or refuting those views. Even if they have not personally paid attention to the stock market since 1982, today’s investors are living in a time and place where recitations of the feelings of others who have experienced the market are heard regularly. It is helpful, to appreciate this sense, to quote one person’s argument against market timing, from the 1999 book Dow 40,000 by David Elias: An example of what can happen when an individual waits for the Dow to indicate “the perfect time” to invest is the saga of Joe, a friend of mine. Joe started calling me in 1982 when the Dow was just over 1000, looking for the right time to get into equities. Over the years, he continued to seek a pullback that would be his perfect moment. Today, at age 62, Joe still has his money parked in bank CDs. He has missed the entire bull market and all its thousand-point milestones. Even now, Joe does not realize that there never is a perfect time. When the market recovers from a pullback, it generally goes to new highs.7 There is something superﬁcially convincing about this passage, especially when it is combined, as in the next paragraph in Elias’s book, with illustrations of the power of compound interest when returns are high (as they have recently been in the stock market), suggesting that the stock market is your chance to become really and truly rich. The tale has emotional immediacy, as would a story about a driving mistake that led to a serious accident or a story about the advantages of asking the boss for a raise. A related reason why an argument built around such a story has such appeal is that—by presenting successful investing as a process of mastering one’s own internal impulses rather than taking account of our present situation in history—it invites the reader to forget what is special about the present time in terms of the level of the market. Normal people think a lot about controlling their own impulses—for example, about disciplining themselves to good work rather than dissipation, about staying slim rather than getting fat—and so arguments that appeal to such self-control have more 50 STR UC TUR AL FAC TOR S resonance than articles about the history of price-earnings ratios. The appeal of Elias’s argument is also that it calls to mind the pain of regret, the emotional reasons we have for investing now, a point to which I will return later in this chapter. When arguments become so detached from an analysis of historical data, the only impact on people’s thinking made by actual data is a vague sense, from casual inspection of very recent data, that the market has always reversed declines. Many media accounts routinely tell stories about the satisfaction felt by those who have invested in stocks in years past, with the clear suggestion to the reader that “you can do it too.” To cite only one among numerous examples, a 1999 article in USA Weekend, a national Sunday magazine insert for newspapers, carried an article entitled “How to (Really) Get Rich in America.” The article gives examples of investor successes and offers the hypothetical story of a twenty-two-year-old college graduate earning $30,000 a year with annual real income raises of 1%. “If she saved only 10% of her income and invested the savings in an S&P index fund she’d have a net worth of $1.4 million on retirement at age 67, in today’s dollars.”8 These calculations assume that the S&P index fund earns a riskless 8% real (inﬂation-corrected) return. There is no mention of the possibility that the return might not be so high over time, and that she might not end up a millionaire. An article with a very similar title, “Everybody Ought to Be Rich,” appeared in the Ladies’ Home Journal in 1929.9 It performed some very similar calculations, yet similarly omitted to describe the possibility that anything could go wrong in the long term. The article became notorious after the 1929 crash. These seemingly convincing discussions of potential increases in the stock market are rarely offered i
