small investor. This was a tenet throughout this life, and unlike Charles Dow, Wyckoff was a prolific writer and publisher. His seminal work, The Richard Wyckoff Method of Trading and Investing in Stocks, first published in the early 1930’s, as a correspondence course, remains the blueprint which all Wall Street investment banks still use today. It is essentially a course of instruction, and although hard to find, is still available in a hard copy version from vintage booksellers. Throughout his life, Wyckoff was always keen to ensure that the self directed investor was given an insight into how the markets actually worked, and in 1907 launched a hugely successful monthly magazine called The Ticker, later merged into The Magazine of Wall Street, which became even more popular. One of the many reasons for this was his view of the market and market behaviour. First, he firmly believed that to be successful you needed to do you own technical analysis, and ignore the views of the ‘so called’ experts and the financial media. Second, he believed that this approach was an art, and not a science. The message that Wyckoff relayed to his readers, and to those who attended his courses and seminars was a simple one. Through his years of studying the markets and in working on Wall Street he believed that prices moved on the basic economic principle of supply and demand, and that by observing the price volume relationship, it was possible to forecast future market direction. Like Charles Dow and Jesse Livermore, who Wyckoff interviewed many times and subsequently published in the Magazine of Wall Street, all these greats from the past, had one thing in common. They all used the the ticker tape, as the source of their inspiration, revealing as it did, the basic laws of supply and demand with price, volume, time and trend at its heart. From his work, Wyckoff detailed three basic laws. 1.The Law of Supply and Demand This was his first and basic law, borne out of his experience as a broker with a detailed inside knowledge of how the markets react to the ongoing battle of price action, minute by minute and bar by bar. When demand is greater than supply, then prices will rise to meet this demand, and conversely when supply is greater then demand then prices will fall, with the over supply being absorbed as a result. Consider the winter sales! Prices fall and the buyers come in to absorb over supply. 2.The Law of Cause and Effect The second law states that in order to have an effect, you must first have a cause, and furthermore, the effect will be in direct proportion to the cause. In other words, a small amount of volume activity will only result in a small amount of price action. This law is applied to a number of price bars and will dictate the extent of any subsequent trend. If the cause is large, then the effect will be large as well. If the cause is small, then the effect will also be small. The simplest analogy here is of a wave at sea. A large wave hitting a
