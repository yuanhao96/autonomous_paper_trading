Candle charts display a more detailed and accurate map of the market than do bar charts. A "It is not an exaggerationto Japanesebook that I had translated stated, say that candlesticks are the best in the world and a very exquisite creation for charts."l This is because,as detailed below, candle charts oPen new avenues of analysis and offer many advantages over bar charts: 1 . Candle charts will pictorially display the supply-demand situation by showing who is winning the battle between the bulls and the bears. Bar charts do not. 2 . Like bar charts, candle charts will show the trend of the market, but candle charts add another dimension of analysis by revealing the force behind the move. 3 . Bar chart techniques can often take weeks to transmit a reversal signal. However, candle charts will often send out clues of imminent reversals in one to three sessions.The result is that candle charts often provide the opportunity for more timely trades. These are just some reasonswhy the flames of interest in candle charts grow ever brighter. In just a few years, candle charts have joined bar charts and point and figure charts as a basic charting technique. Candle charts are drawn using the same data as bar charts (the open, high, low, and close), so they send all the same signals that can be found ot but charts. Yet, as just discussed,the candles offer many advantages over bar charts, so using candle charts instead of bar charts is a win-win situation. When you use bar charts you only get bar chart signals. But, with candle charts you get all the bar chart signals, plus you gain the Candles unique and powerful insights provided by the candles. so, why use a bar chart? Becausethe ]apaneseare major players in most of the world's markets, there is strong interest in how the |apaneseuse their technicalsto trade. Candles are the most popular form of technical analysisin |apan. The importance of the candles for the |apanese trading community is illustrated in the following quote from the European magazine,Euroweek. This article quotes an English trader who works at a Japanesebank. He states:"All the |apanesetradershere-and that's in the foreign exchange, futures and equities markets-use the candles. It might be difficult to work out the billions of dollars traded in London on interpretations of these charts each day, but the number would be significant."2 Think about it: Although billions are traded every day based on the candle chart signals, until recently we had no knowledge of how the ]apaneseviewed the market with their technicals.This is hard to believe. Knowing the candles and their other technical tools discussed in this book may help answer the question, "What are the |apanesegoing to do next?." Yearsago, I met with the head of technical analysisfor one of fapan's largest life insurance companies (this fapanese trader wanted to meet with me to learn how I used western technicalsto trade). IzVhenhe walked into my office, he saw I had candle charts on my desk. In a surprised voice, he asked: "You know about the candles?." I responded that I did. I then asked if he used them. He told me that his company's top managementwould meet eachMonday to discussthe world markets.At these meetings, he would bring his candle charts to offer his technical views. Then he pointed to my candle charts and asked: "How many other Americans know about this?." I said no one (this was before the publication of my first book). He looked relieved. I then continued, "But I will soon have a book out about it." "So, many others will know about this?," he asked in a disappointed tone. The point of the story is that the Japanesetrader came to me to learn about how we, in the West, use technicals.The fapanesehave learned from us and they know almost all of our technical methods. In most of the candlestickbooks and articlesI have had translated from Japaneseto English, there was at least some referenceto western technicaltechniques.A quote from one of the books I had translated stated, "To understand stocks it is not enough to know the |apanesechart methods . . . one must absorbthe best parts of western te
