I did not know that 40 years later Livermore and I would have a date with destiny—or that I would devote more than a year of my life to investigating his life. I did not know that I would ultimately get to know him as well as anyone ever did get to know him. Livermore was a person of great secrecy, mystery, and silence. He strove to control his emotions and thereby overcome the human frailty of passions that we all suffer from. Above all, he wanted to beat the game, solve the puzzle, best the stock market.
