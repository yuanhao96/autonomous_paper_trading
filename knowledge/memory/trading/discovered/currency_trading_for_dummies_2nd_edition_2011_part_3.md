Part III: Developing a Trading Plan The military has an old saying: “Proper planning prevents piss-poor performance.” The forex market is pretty much always open and constantly moving. To swim in this ocean and avoid the sharks requires an organized and disciplined approach to trading. In this part, I detail different trading styles, highlight concrete strategies, and provide a game plan for spotting trade opportunities and being prepared to act on them. I introduce you to my preferred technical analysis tools and my approach to using them. I also explore risk-management considerations and rules in depth, because what you don’t know can cost you.
