Chapter 1). As we'll see further on, making money trading forex can be easier than in stocks and other more traditional asset markets, particularly in bear markets. However, you do need to do your homework, especially if trading with leverage, which adds risk as well as reward. Part of that homework is to learn more conservative, simpler techniques that make it easier to succeed at forex than those most commonly used. Until recently, there was no single source for learning this more sensible, conservative forex. No longer. This is the only book to gather these methods into one collection. Part of forex's reputation for excessive risk comes from stories appearing in the mainstream media. The typical plotline runs like this: Some gullible novices believed a broker's get-rich-quick pitch about how they'd score fast money with little effort or background in forex. These geniuses were shocked (shocked!) to find out otherwise. The conclusion: Forex should either be avoided altogether or is unsuitable for most people. If you're smart enough to be reading this book, you will see the absurdity of that reasoning. Just because there are individuals who behave stupidly with cars or power tools doesn't mean that these should be avoided altogether. The same goes for forex, including the typical leveraged trading. If you've had the right preparation and have the discipline to practice proper trade planning risk and money management (RAMM), you can keep the risk to acceptable levels, just as with any other kind of investing or trading. As with driving, there are ways to simulate the experience until you're ready for the real thing, and ways to then start slowly under less challenging conditions until you're ready for more challenging conditions No Uptick Rule: Just as Easy to Profit in a Falling Market as in a Rising One Just as it's easier to row with the current than against it, it's easier to profit by trading in the direction of an established market trend. Unlike with stocks (and other financial markets), in forex it's as easy to profit from falling markets as from rising ones. This is a huge advantage of forex markets. During an uptrend, when prices are rising, most traders go long, meaning they buy the asset with the hope of selling it at a higher price. They're attempting to buy low and sell high, the classic way most people view investing. During a downtrend, when prices are falling, it's easier to profit by trading with that downtrend. So, the more sophisticated equities traders try to exploit that downward momentum and sell short; that is, sell borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back later at lower price, returning the borrowed shares, and profiting on the difference—for example, sell borrowed shares for $100 per share, buy them at $80, return them to a broker, and pocket $20 per share. However, most stock exchanges are controlled and regulated by those who have an interest in keeping stock prices high. The politicians who oversee market regulations and the executives who run the listed companies look better when prices are up and are more likely to keep their jobs. Falling prices make them look bad, and extended downtrends can be toxic for their careers. Many of the major stock exchanges tend to make profiting from downtrends harder. For example, many exchanges have some kind of uptick rule that permits shorting the stock only when price is rising. That keeps short sellers out when prices are moving lower and the odds are in their favor, and forces them to sell into rising prices and absorb losses until the downtrend resumes. During the strongest downtrends that offer the fastest profits, upticks are rare so many have no chance to ride the move lower at all. In times of market panics, which can be incredibly profitable for short sellers, exchanges have banned short selling altogether. Since the start of the Great Financial Crisis, short selling has been periodically banned during the juiciest downtrends in both the United States and Europe: In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did so in September of 2008.3 Regulators in Spain, Italy, Belgium, and France banned short selling of their banking stocks in August of 2011.4 Some markets employ circuit breaker rules that automatically stop trading once an instrument has fallen a certain percentage in a given day. Though ways exist to circumvent these restrictions, they can be more complicated, expensive, and riskier. These added obstacles effectively exclude many individuals from playing strong downtrends even as the big institutions and professionals feast on them. As we'll learn in
