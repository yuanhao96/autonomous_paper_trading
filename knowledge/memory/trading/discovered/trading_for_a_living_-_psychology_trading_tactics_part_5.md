THE TRADING SCENE 53 than at Kennedy International Airport, I walked through glass-enclosed corridors. Clusters of men huddled around monitors trading oil products. When I asked my host whether his traders were hedging or speculating, he looked me straight in the eye and said, "Yes." 1 asked again and received the same answer. Companies crisscross the thin line between hedging and speculating based on inside information. Employees of trading firms have a psychological advantage - they can be more relaxed because their own money is not at risk.
