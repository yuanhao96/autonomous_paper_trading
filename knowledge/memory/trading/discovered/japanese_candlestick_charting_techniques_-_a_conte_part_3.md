Chapter 2 on the history of Japanese technical analysis. If there are any mistakes that remain, they are those that I failed to correct. I want to thank again "idea a day" Bruce Kamich. Bruce is a friend and a fellow futures technician. Throughout our 15-year friendship he has provided me with many valuable ideas and suggestions. Probably two of the most important were his suggestion that I join the MTA and his constant haranguing until I agreed to write a book about candlesticks. Then there's the publishing staff of the New York Institute of Finance. They were all great, but those with whom I worked most closely deserve extra praise. Susan Barry and Sheck Cho patiently, skillfully and affably guided a neophyte author through the labyrinth of the book publishing business. Of course there is my family. At the time that I was writing this book, our newborn son Evan entered the picture (with all the excitement about candlesticks, I came close to calling him Candlesticks Nison). Try writing a book with a newborn and a rambunctious four-year-old daughter, Rebecca, and you start to get an idea of how much my wife, Bonnie, contributed to this book. She cared for the children while I maladroitly pummeled away at the keyboard. Obviously, she had the harder job. For each chapter's heading, and throughout the book, I used Japanese proverbs or sayings. Many times proverbs in the United States are considered trite and are rarely used. This is not so in Japan where proverbs are respected. Besides being enjoyable to read, the Japanese proverbs offer insights into Japanese beliefs and perspectives. I would like to vii viii Acknowledgements thank the following publishers for the use of their material for the proverbs and sayings used in this book: University of Oklahoma Press, Charles E. Tuttle, and Kenkyusha Ltd. Finally, I must give proper and legal acknowledgements to many of the services I relied upon during my writing and research.

T PREFACE " A clever hawk hides his claws" W o u l d you like to learn a technical system refined by centuries of use, but virtually unknown here? A system so versatile that it can be fused with any Western technical tool? A system as pleasurable to use as it is powerful? If so, this book on Japanese candlestick charting techniques is for you. You should find it valuable no matter what your background in technical analysis. Japanese candlestick charts are older than bar charts and point and figure charts. Candlesticks are exciting, powerful, and fun. Using candlesticks will help improve your market analysis. My focus will be mainly on the U.S. markets, but the tools and techniques in this book should be applicable to almost any market. Candlestick techniques can be used for speculation and hedging. They can be used for futures, equities, options, or anywhere technical analysis is applied. By reading this book you will discover how candlesticks will add another dimension of analysis. Do not worry if you have never seen a candlestick chart. The assumption of this book is that they are new to you. Indeed, they are new to the vast majority of the American and European trading and investing community. If you are a seasoned technician, you will discover how joining Japanese candlesticks with your other technical tools can create a powerful synergy of techniques. The chapters on joining Japanese candlestick techniques with Western technical tools will be of strong interest to you. If you are an amateur technician, you will find how effective candlestick charts are as a stand alone charting method. To help guide you, I x Preface have included a glossary of all the western and Japanese candlestick terms used. The Japanese technicals are honed by hundreds of years of evolution. Yet, amazingly, we do not know how the Japanese analyze our markets with their traditional technical tool called candlesticks. This is disconcerting if you consider that they are among the biggest players in the financial markets. The Japanese are big technical traders. Knowing how the Japanese use candlestick charts to analyze both our markets and theirs may help you answer the question "What are the Japanese going to do?" The Japanese use a combination of western chart and candlestick techniques to analyze the markets. Why shouldn't we do the same? If you do not learn about Japanese candlestick charts, your competition will! If you like reading about colorful terminology like "hanging-man lines," "dark-cloud covers," and "evening stars" then this book is for you. If you subscribe to one of the multitude of services now providing candlestick charts and would like to learn how to use these charts, then this book is for you. In the first part of the book, you learn how to draw and interpret over 50 candlestick lines and formations. This will slowly and clearly lay a solid foundation for the second part where you will learn to use candlesticks in combination with Western technical techniques. This book will not give you market omniscience. It will, however, open new avenues of analysis and will show how Japanese candlesticks can "enlighten" your trading. Contents Preface
