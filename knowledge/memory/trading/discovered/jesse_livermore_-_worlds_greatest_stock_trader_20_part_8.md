group known in Wall Street as the “Big Ten” were large holders of these particular stocks and have seen their plans and pools wrecked by what were natural economic developments, coupled with much shrewd short selling. One of the tales started and circulated in the financial district yesterday, was that Livermore had the backing in a bear campaign of Walter P. Chrysler, who was said to be piqued because he suspected that the Chicago-Detroit group had hammered at Chrysler motors in the market, driving it down below 55 from its high of 135 this year. The outstanding bear leader appears to be Livermore, who has regained a tremendous fortune through adroit short selling and who, temporarily at least, is regarded as being exactly “right” on this market. Cutten, who started as a grain trader, has amassed an estimated $100 million or more in the stock market during the last three years of bull markets. Cutten is the leader of the bull faction and is temporarily at least regarded as “wrong” on the market. Mr. Cutten was in New York and watched the market from the office of the head of the stock exchange. His expressed opinion to friends is that much of the selling had been hysterical, and that he believes good stocks should be held for higher prices. He has not changed his formerly stated position about the long distance outlook. Neither has he made any statement about the market for publication.

The Times article had more to tell: Jesse L. Livermore, who has been in eclipse, so far as stock market operations are concerned, for several years, has made a smashing comeback, if Wall Street reports are true. The comeback of Mr. Livermore as one of the foremost market players is another Wall Street wonder. As a boy he was a board marker in Boston brokerage houses where he developed such skill at tape reading that, despite limited capital he was barred from every bucket shop in Boston and New York. This gave him the nickname that has stuck to him through later years of the “Boy Plunger.” Coming to New York and playing the markets skilfully after long series of ups and downs he struck an extended winning streak and made a fortune of many millions. It is reported that in the current bull market he decided that stocks were too high and guessed wrong. The continued advances of such issues as General Motors, Steel, General Electric and others is said to have taken back a large part of his fortune. He was short of them all and covered time and time again. It was reported in the financial district that he was down to his large irrevocable annuities, of which he has several for himself and his family, acquired during years of earlier prosperity. Arthur Cutten, Livermore’s rival, might be mistaken for a country storekeeper. He cares nothing for conventions,
