Chapter 7, “Money Management Formulas”). If Triple Screen flags a trade but you realize that a logical stop would risk more than 2% of your equity, skip that trade. Set profit targets. Profit targets are flexible and depend on your goals and capital. If you are a well-capitalized, long-term-oriented trader, you may build up a large position at an early stage of a bull market, repeatedly taking buy signals from the daily charts, as long as the weekly trend is up. Take your profits after the weekly EMA turns flat. The reverse applies to downtrends. Another option is to take profits whenever prices on the daily charts hit their channel line. If you go long, sell when prices hit the upper channel line and look to reposition on the next pullback to the daily moving average. If you go short, cover when prices fall to their lower channel line and look to reposition short on the next rally to the EMA. A short-term-oriented trader can use the signals of a two-day EMA of Force Index to exit trades. If you buy in an uptrend when the twoday EMA of Force Index turns negative, sell when it turns positive. If you go short in a downtrend after the two-day EMA of Force Index turns positive, cover when it turns negative. Beginners often approach markets like a lottery—buy a ticket and sit in front of the TV to find out whether you have won. You will know that you are becoming a professional when you start spending almost as much time thinking about exits as looking for entries. SCREEN THREE The third screen helps us pinpoint entry points. Live data can help savvy traders but hurt beginners who may slip into day-trading. TRADING 137 Use an intraday breakout or pullback to enter trades without realtime data. When the first two screens give you a buy signal (the weekly is up, but the daily is down), place a buy order at the high of the previous day or a tick higher. A tick is the smallest price fluctuation permitted in any market. We expect the major uptrend to reassert itself and catch a breakout in its direction. Place a buy order, good for one day only. If prices break out above the previous day’s high, you will be stopped in automatically. You do not have to watch prices intraday, just give your order to a broker. When the first two screens tell you to sell short (the weekly is down, but the daily is up), place a sell order at the previous day’s low or a tick lower. We expect the downtrend to reassert itself, and try to catch the downside breakout. If prices break below the previous day’s low, they will trigger your entry. Daily ranges can be very wide, and placing an order to buy at the top can be expensive. Another option is to buy below the market. If you are trying to buy a pullback to the EMA, calculate where that EMA is likely to be tomorrow and place your order at that level. Alternatively, use the SafeZone indicator (see page 173) to find how far the market is likely to dip below its previous day’s low and place your order at that level. Reverse these approaches for shorting in downtrends. The advantage of buying upside breakouts is that you follow an impulse move. The disadvantage is that you buy high and your stop is far away. The advantage of bottom fishing is that you get your goods on sale and your stop is closer. The disadvantage is the risk of getting caught in a downside reversal. A “breakout entry” is more reliable, but profits are smaller; a “bottom-fishing entry” is riskier, but the profits are greater. Make sure to test both methods in your markets. Use real-time data, if available, for entering trades. When the first two screens give you a buy signal (the weekly is up, but the daily is down), use live data to get long. You could follow a breakout from the opening range, when prices rally above the high of the first 15 to 30 minutes of trading, or apply technical analysis to intraday charts and finesse your entry. When trying to short, you may enter on a downside breakout from the opening range. You could also monitor the market intraday and use technical analysis to enter into a short trade, using live charts. The techniques for finding buy and sell signals on real-time charts are the same as on daily charts, only their speed is much higher. If you use 138 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING weeklies and dailies to get in, use them also to get out. Once a live chart gives an entry signal, avoid the temptation to exit using intraday data. Do not forget that you entered that trade on the basis of weekly and daily charts, expecting to hold for several days. Do not be distracted by the intraday chop if you are trading swings that last several days. DAY-TRADING Day-trading means entering and exiting trades on the same day. Watching money flow from the screen into your account is extremely appealing. Surely we are smart enough to use modern technology to outrun slow-moving folks who follow their stocks through the newspapers. Every partial truth contains a dangerous lie. Day-trading can bring profits to professionals, but it is also a common last stop for losers who blow what little is left of their accounts. Day-trading offers advantages and disadvantages, while placing extreme demands on its practitioners. Day-trading offers one of the markets’ greatest challenges, but it is amazing how little literature on it exists. There are several “daytrading for dummies” types of books, a few get-rich-quick jobs, but not a single definitive volume on day-trading. Bad day-traders write bad books and good day-traders are too action-oriented to sit down to write. A good day-trader is a street-smart person with fast reflexes. He is quick, confident, and flexible. Successful day-traders are so focused on the immediate results that they do not make good writers. I hope one of them will rise to the challenge of writing a book, but in the meantime, here are a few notes, even though each of them deserves its own chapter in a thick book on day-trading. The late 1990s saw an explosion of interest in day-tradi
