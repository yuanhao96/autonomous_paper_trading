CHAPTER 1 9. 10. SO YOU WANT TO TRADE FOREX? 11 not emotionally. Reactive trading will cause you to lose all your money, whereas responsive trading will allow you to think through your next move and take advantage of the next opportunity that knocks. Is your ego more constructive or destructive? Are you more humble or more arrogant? Do you make your decisions based on your pride and ego or based on logic regardless of the consequences to your ego? If you go through life allowing your decisions and actions to come from a destructive ego, you will be no different than the person who purchased a brand new sailboat and ignored the first line of the owner’s manual: “Avoid storms at all costs. Do not go looking for storms as you sail your boat, they will naturally find you!” A destructive ego is nothing more than a storm chaser living through one bad storm after another. A constructive ego keeps you focused on all the details necessary to avoid any and all storms as you sail through life. A person with a constructive ego believes their mind is like a parachute; it only works when it is open. A person with a destructive ego thinks he or she already knows everything. Unfortunately, when it comes to trading, the market will teach that destructive ego the true definition of humility. When conflict shows its face to a constructive ego, the constructive ego, through humility, will in the end fight to be happy rather than right. Are you more positive about life or more negative? How you answer this question will greatly determine your overall happiness in life. Is your glass always half empty or half full? There is a law that is every bit as much valid as the law of gravity: it is called the law of attraction. The law of attraction stipulates that whatever we think about, those thoughts will radiate out of our being and create circumstances and events and attract people that align with our thoughts. When we think positive thoughts, that positive mindset will radiate out of us, creating positive circumstances and positive events in our life and, as a result, will attract positive people into our lives. The flip side of this law is also true. When we think negative thoughts, that negative mindset will create negative circumstances and negative events in our lives, attracting negative people into our lives. The power of this law plays an incredible part in determining your success or failure in life. Positive people are considered optimistic people, whereas negative people are considered pessimistic, 12 11. THE 10 ESSENTIALS OF FOREX TRADING but the only real difference between an optimist and a pessimist is that the optimist believes there is an answer to every question and a solution to every problem, whereas the pessimist believes most questions have no answer and most problems are unsolvable. This mindset significantly limits the pessimist’s potential, success, and happiness in life. Optimists, on the other hand, create positive outcomes via the law of attraction. The simple shifting of your mindset from negative to positive changes your entire world. Negative people are constantly shifting blame and frustrated about how unfair life is; they walk around with a victim mentality. Positive people accept responsibility for their circumstances and place themselves in a position to figure out how to avoid negative situations in the future. If you want to become a successful trader, you will have to purge your negative attitude and adopt a positive mindset and attitude. Negativity when trading only creates more negative circumstances, more negative events and financial losses. Do you fear your mistakes or do you embrace them and learn from them? All people make mistakes, but only wise people learn from them. The only true mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. Mistakes show us what needs improvement. Without mistakes, how would we know what we need to work on? Avoiding situations in which you might make a mistake could be the biggest mistake of all. When you have the courage to go out on a limb and make a decision, right or wrong, you risk making a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. Strong people make as many mistakes as weak people—the difference is that strong people admit their mistakes, laugh at them, learn from them, and become stronger. When you make mistakes, problems usually surface, which creates fear and anxiety. Pessimists live a life fearful of making any mistake because that mistake will create a problem, and just about all problems, in their opinion, have no solution. Optimists can make just as many mistakes as, if not more than, pessimists. However, when a problem arises for an optimist, they aggressively work on it, believing it can be resolved, and the second they see the solution, the fear and anxiety dissipates. When life hands you lemons, do you waste time sucking on them or do you learn to make lemonade? Making mistakes is part of being human. Just about all of life’s important lessons can only be
