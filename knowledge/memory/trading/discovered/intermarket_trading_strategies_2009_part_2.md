Many thanks also to Murray Ruggiero, one of the world’s leading experts in intermarket analysis, who contributed to improving the final version of the book by making valuable comments and suggestions on a preliminary manuscript. Murray is Vice President of Research and Development of TradersStudio, contributing editor for Futures Magazine and author of several books on trading systems. Special thanks to my wife, Erifili, for her love and patient support, and for putting up with late nights, despite having no actual interest in the subject. I also want to thank Jayanthi Gopalakrishnan, the editor of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine, for encouraging me to write the articles for the magazine and helping me later with the task of finding the best publisher for the book. Many thanks also to Caitlin Cornish, my editor at John Wiley & Sons, and to her assistant Aimée Dibbens, for their guidance and support during the publication process. It is difficult to appreciate the effort and hours that go into researching and writing a book of this nature until you’ve had a chance to work on one yourself. The correlation studies involved a huge amount of historical data and I would like to thank Peter Day for helping out with the VBA to manage the data in Excel and Rubi Cabal, marketing director at CSI data, for allowing me access to CSI’s correlation reports. Finally, I would like to thank the technical support staff at Ward Systems Inc., and also Lynn Dufrenne, Lead Support Representative at Equis Technical Support for their help in solving the unavoidable software problems. Introduction With the emergence of the internet and international cross border trading, the world’s futures and equity markets started to converge, making intermarket analysis an essential constituent of technical analysis. Single market technical analysis indicators were designed in the 1980s for national markets, and are no longer sufficient nor can be relied upon for analyzing the constantly changing market dynamics. But how do markets interact and influence each other and how can we use intermarket relationships to construct a viable technical system? Because the answers have been so elusive, they became the motivation for my research. The more I looked into it, the more I became convinced that there is clear and incontrovertible evidence that the markets are linked to each other, and incorporating intermarket correlations into a trading discipline can give a trading advantage. Two years of research later, I finally came up with some rules and mathematical formulae for intermarket trading. It has been more than 15 years since John Murphy, a pioneer on the subject, wrote his first book on intermarket analysis. The material in my book is based on original research not published anywhere else and, unlike Murphy’s intuitive chart-based approach, I am going to use mathematical and statistical principles to develop and design intermarket trading systems appropriate for long- and short-term and even day trading. Although the book makes extensive use of market statistics obtained from hundreds of correlation studies, the data and empirical findings are not its heart. They serve as a background in developing the trading systems presented in the second part of the book, as well as help shape our thinking about the way the financial markets work. The key difference between Intermarket Trading Strategies and other books on trading lies in its philosophy. I believe that knowing how the markets work is, in the end, more important than relying on a “black box” mechanical system that produced profitable trades in the past but not even the creator of the system can fully explain xii Introduction why. The focus of this book is how intermarket analysis can be used to forecast future equity and index price movements by introducing custom indicators and intermarketbased systems. A total of 29 conventional and five neural network trading systems are provided to trade gold, the S&P ETF (SPY), S&P e-mini futures, DAX and FTSE futures, gold and oil stocks, commodities, sector and international ETF, and finally the yen and the euro. Naturally, past results are no guarantee of future performance. Even so, the results of out-of-sample back-testing are compelling enough to merit attention. Some results are more compelling.
