Chapter 6 1. Even so, only three in a hundred Americans owned stocks. Many had borrowed heavily to play the market, entranced by John J. Raskob’s article, “Everybody Ought to Be Rich” in the August 1929 Ladies’ Home Journal and Edgar Lawrence Smith’s proof that stocks outperform bonds (Common Stocks as Long-Term Investments. New York: The MacMillan Company, 1925). 2. “Stock Prices Slump $14,000,000,000 in Nation-Wide Stampede to Unload; Bankers to Support Market Today,” New York Times, October 29, 1929; David M. Kennedy, Freedom from Fear, The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999; John Brooks, Once in Golconda, A True Drama of Wall Street; 1920–1938. New York: Harper & Row, 1969. Roger Babson’s famous warning, “I repeat what I said at this time last year and the year before, that sooner or later a crash is coming,” was useless. 3. Kennedy, Freedom from Fear. Kennedy notes that interest payment on the national debt rose from $25 million annually in 1914 to $1 billion annually in the 1920s due to World War I, accounting for one-third of the federal budget. The actual budget in 1929 was $3.127 billion a year (Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 1999—Historical Tables, Table 1.1—Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits: 1789–2003. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office). 4. By the bottom tick on November 13, the market had lost $26 to $30 billion of its roughly $80 billion precrash value (Kennedy, op. cit., Brooks, op. cit.). World War I cost approximately $32 billion (Robert McElvaine, The Great Depression: America, 1929–1941. New York: Three Rivers Press, 1993; also Hugh Rockoff, It’s Over, Over There: The U.S. Economy in World War I, National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 10580). 5. Charlie Munger reported that all the Buffetts, including those employed elsewhere, worked at the store, in a letter to Katharine Graham dated November 13, 1974. 6. Coffee with Congress. 7. Roger Lowenstein, Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist. New York: Doubleday, 1996. 8. Roger Lowenstein, in Buffett, cites Leila Buffett’s memoirs for this fact. 9. Ernest Buffett letter to Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Buffett and Marjorie Bailey, August 17, 1931. 10. “Union State Bank Closes Doors Today: Reports Assets in Good Condition; Reopening Planned,” Omaha World-Herald, August 15, 1931. Characteristically, the story understated the bank’s dire situation. It went into reorganization under regulatory supervision and filed for bankruptcy. 11. Howard had borrowed $9,000 to buy $10,000 of stock in the bank. The stock was now worthless. The house and mortgage were in Leila’s name. Standard Accident Insurance Company, Howard Homan Buffett application for fidelity bond. 12. “Buffett, Sklenicka and Falk Form New Firm,” Omaha Bee News, September 8, 1931. Statement of Buffett, Sklenicka & Co. for the month ending September 30, 1931. 13. The wave crested in December 1931 with the failure of the Bank of the United States, an officialsounding institution that had nothing to do with the government. The $286 million collapse broke a record, took down 400,000 depositors, and was understood by everyone—in one sense or another—as a failure of public trust (Kennedy, Freedom from Fear). It kicked the quivering legs out from under the banking system and sent the already battered economy into collapse. 14. Although its return on revenues was low, the firm by then was consistently profitable and would remain so, with the exception of a couple of months. 15. By the end of 1932, Howard Buffett was averaging 40–50% more in commissions than in 1931, based on financial statements of Buffett, Sklenicka & Co. 16. Charles Lindbergh Jr., “The Little Eaglet,” was kidnapped on March 1, 1932. His body was found on May 12, 1932. Many parents in the 1920s and 1930s were preoccupied with kidnapping, a fear that actually began with the Leopold and Loeb case in 1924 but peaked with the Lindbergh baby. An Omaha country-club groundskeeper claimed he was kidnapped and robbed of $7. In Dallas a minister faked his own kidnapping, trussing himself to his church’s electric fan (Omaha World-Herald, August 4, 1931, and June 20, 1931). 17. According to Roberta Buffett Bialek, Howard once had rheumatic fever, which may have weakened his heart. 18. Interview with Doris Buffett. 19. Interview with Doris Buffett. Warren also remembers this. 20. Interview with Roberta Buffett Bialek. 21. Interviews with Jack Frost, Norma Thurston-Perna, Stu Erikson, Lou Battistone. 22. The correct clinical term for Leila’s condition is unknown, but it may have boiled down to a literal pain in the neck: occipital neuralgia, a chronic pain disorder caused by irritation or injury to the occipital nerve, which is located in the back of the scalp. This disorder causes throbbing, migrainelike pain, which originates at the nape of the neck and spreads up and around the forehead and scalp. Occipital neuralgia can result from physical stress, trauma, or repeated contraction of the neck muscles. 23. Interview with Katie Buffett. This may have been while pregnant with either Warren or Bertie. 24. Interview with Katie Buffett. 25. “Beer Is Back!
