appearances or customs. Shy, quiet and unassuming, he has many times sat back in the corner of a Pullman smoking room and heard casual travelers discussing his stock market 8467_Smitten_01_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:38 PM Page 10 • 10 • JESSE LIVERMORE : WORLD ’ S GREATEST STOCK TRADER feats without disclosing his identity. When not attending to his businesses, he is a gentleman farmer on his estate near Chicago. On the other hand, Livermore is the fastidious, welldressed man of the city. Slight and blond, and he wears his dark clothes well, rides in Rolls-Royce cars, maintains a retinue of servants, half a dozen places of residence and probably the most luxurious offices in New York located atop the Hecksher Building. Temperamentally, the two are entirely unlike. Cutten is calm, slow of speech and not at all impetuous. Livermore is quick, nervous and excitable, given to superstitions, but willing to bet his last nickel if he thinks he is right. Livermore has been down not once, but half a dozen times. Cutten at least in the last years, has typified the bull market. The markets of the next month or so are likely to prove wildly exciting affairs, because of the direct pull and haul against each other of a wide variety of economic factors, all of them powerful. It is now pretty certain that when stocks go up, Mr. Cutten will be there helping them along. It is equally certain that when they decline, Mr. Livermore will be in the market hammering away. There is however no personal battle between them. “Humph, it’s never personal!” uttered Livermore, as he finished the article and placed it on his desk.

This is your doing and you are going to pay. I’m broke thanks to you. No, I’m more than broke. I owe my broker thousands of dollars of margin money, but I still got my gun. I’m headed down there to blow your brains out. Next time you answer your door I’ll be standing there and the next thing you know you’ll be walking through the gates of hell, which is where you deserve to be you . . .” Livermore slammed the phone down. It all sprang from these articles, picked up by every paper in the United States, blaming him for the crash. But it wasn’t him. He wasn’t that powerful; no one was, not even the men from the great House of Morgan. But that wouldn’t stop the public from thinking he had triggered the crash and was driving it down by selling, selling, selling. He had called the Times and given them an interview explaining that he was not to blame, but it had not worked. No matter what, it seemed people wanted to blame him, maybe just so they could have
