In the two hours in which trading was limited on the New York Stock Exchange active issues passed through one of the wildest breaks in history. Final quotations revealed net losses ranging from 5 to 20 points and the aggregate depreciation in open market values was estimated at $1,000,000,000 (one billion) or more. The total turnover was 3,488,100 shares which represented the second heaviest volume for a Saturday since the Stock Exchange was established. During the first half hour trading took place at a rate of more than 8,500,000 shares for a full five-hour day.

Livermore is presumed to be heavily short of leading stocks and Cutten heavily long of the same group of issues. The ascendency of Livermore to the position he once held as the country’s leading market operator on the bear side, after several years of eclipse, is one of the most interesting developments in the market. The short selling which it was generally agreed was the principal factor in today’s decline, served to induce further liquidation of stocks and the cumulative effect was reflected in a demoralized market in certain issues. It was plain that the market was receiving no organized support. Stocks which ordinarily have powerful backing were allowed to shift for themselves. With stocks driving higher during the last few months following each downward reaction, the situation was ready made for Livermore. The Street stories are that he went short 8467_Smitten_01_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:38 PM Page 8 • 8 • JESSE LIVERMORE : WORLD ’ S GREATEST STOCK TRADER of a large line of issues such as: United States Steel, Montgomery Ward, Simmons Co., General Electric, American and Foreign Power and half a dozen other of the market’s pivotal issues.
