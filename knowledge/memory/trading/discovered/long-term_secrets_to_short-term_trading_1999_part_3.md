Chapter 2 It's a Question of Price and Time Like a circle being squared, Going round and round A wheel within a wheel Spinning a syncopated sound Creating cycles that we find Will o'wisps of our mind. All You Will Ever Need to Know about Cycles Our charts are a record of price activity over time the horizontal scale being time, the vertical scale representing price. An entire technical school is; devoted to the study of time, the cycle watchers. These good-thinking people count the number of minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years between high and low points in search for some master time cycle to tell us price will behave in the future as it has in the past. Being a somewhat sleek learner (an even slower unlearner), I spent almost 15 vears of my life trying to figure out these time cycles. I am still convinced there are cycles in the market. in fact three of them, but they are not time circles. The root of the problem of time cycle is, that there always seems to be a current, or dominant. cycle, that we can see on our chart right now. The rub is, another cycle is Always about to become dominant, overpowering the one we have just located and invested in. 23 24 Although our first problem is cycle dominance, if there are such cycles, they change direction more often than a politician looking for votes. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the hope was that a combination of high-powered math and high-powered computers would solve this master cycle problem. It has yet to be done. Just what the heck cycle we should lay our bets down on at any given time is impossible to tell. But an even greater problem is the one of magnitude. The cycle crowd deals exclusively with time. But I have yet to find a banker who allows me to deposit days, weeks, or months! By that, I mean that a cyclist might ferret out a market low, say an 18 -year low, but price does not respond much to the upside, climbing up that vertical scale of dollars, the reward mechanism of the game. In theory, calling a major cycle low or high, if you could do it, would produce a move of some magnitude. But in the real world where I live and trade, that has seldom been the case; instead the cycle quickly faded. Sure, price stopped there-in time-and bobbled along for a few days or weeks, but there was not enough price magnitude for a profit. I will prove my point with an actual study of past price activity. Figure 2.1 shows the result of a test of a timing system for Soybeans. I fired up my computer, asking it to buy when a short-term moving average of price crossed above a longer term moving average. This is standard technical stuff. The only variable was time, the number of days in the moving average. Thus it is cycle impacted. A moving average is simply the average closing price for the last "X" number of days. There are no other variables, only time. Figure 2.1 Test of a timing system. Our first test was on Soybean prices from 4/29/75 through 1/1/87, and it looked at all possible combinations of short-term averages from 5 to 50 days against the longer term or second average from 10 to 60 days. 25 The best result, during this time period shown here used a 5-day average against a 2 5-day average. This time-based "system" made $40,075 with 54 profitable trades out of a total of 153. Wow, have we discovered a money machine', Figure 2.2 shows what would have taken place had we traded this system from 1/1/87 through 4/23/98. The results are not promising. Whereas our accuracy at 31 percent winners on 163 trades has improved, we actually lost money, $9,100 to be specific and along the way suffered a drawdown (how much the system went against you before getting back in the black) of $2 8,612. Putting up $2 8,612 to lose $9, 100 is hardly a good wager, The average profit per trade was $-55. What happened to the original cyclical or time influence? Beats me! Reversing the process, I checked to see what two moving averages worked best in the second time period from 1/1/87 into April 23, 1998 (see Figure 2.3). The best combination was a 25-day moving average against a 30-day. This made $34,900 with a nice 59 percent accuracy. This system made S234 per trade and had a drawdown of $13,962. This too, is not a good bet. Applying the best case results back on the earlier data, out of sample, produced a loss of $28,725, as shown in Figure 2.4. Forward, backward., the time or length or cycle of the moving average that worked in one time period does not work in another time period. "Perhaps," you query, "The problem is not that time does not work but that Soybeans do not trend enough." What appears next is the best case study of a moving average crossover system on the British Pound, a very trending market. From 1975 to 1987, the best such crossover system was a 5-day average versus a 45-day, making a most impressive $135 443 Figure 2.2 What might have happened. 26 Figure 2.3 Testing another time period Data POUND Calc Dates 01/01/98 BRITISH 67/99 01/01/87 - Num.
