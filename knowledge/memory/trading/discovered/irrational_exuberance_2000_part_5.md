Part V analyzes the implications of the current speculative bubble for individual investors, institutions, and governments. Several prescriptions for urgently needed policy changes are offered, as are suggestions for ways in which individual investors can lower their exposure to the consequences of a “burst” bubble. This page intentionally left blank Acknowledgments J eremy Siegel, while clearly not agreeing with me on all points, urged me to set down my ideas in this book. He is its real instigator. Jeremy has been a lifelong friend. Our families regularly vacation together, and I learned a distinctive approach to ﬁnance from him while strolling the beach together or watching our children ﬁsh. John Campbell, my former student, then co-author on a dozen scholarly papers on ﬁnancial markets, and for years a close friend, has been my intellectual other half in formulating many of the ideas that led to this book. My original work on volatility in ﬁnancial markets was reﬁned and signiﬁcantly advanced with his collaboration. He has also offered many helpful suggestions for this book and comments on the manuscript. Peter Dougherty, my editor at Princeton University Press, has been an extremely important formative inﬂuence on the book, helping to deﬁne the fundamental aspects of its structure. He has been a great colleague and more—really almost a collaborator. Peter Strupp of Princeton Editorial Associates was an unusually helpful copy editor. xix xx AC KNOWLEDGMENT S I was fortunate to have several excellent research assistants to help me during the writing. Peter Fabrizio unearthed the truth about many of the historical events discussed. Yuanfeng Hou performed careful data analysis. Luis Mancilla was a skillful fact ﬁnder. Steven Pawliczek was the source of many important ideas. I am also blessed with a number of friends and colleagues who read drafts of the manuscript and provided extensive comments: Stefano Athanasoulis, John Geanakoplos, William Konigsberg, Stephen Morris, Sharon Oster, Jay Ritter, Martin Shubik, and James Tobin. My colleagues at the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics at Yale University—Donald Brown, Stefan Krieger, and William Nordhaus—have been a great help. I must also take this occasion to express gratitude to our late founder, Alfred Cowles III, an investment manager in the early part of this century and patron of mathematical economics, who tabulated the pre-1926 dividend and earnings data used in this book. Help from my colleagues at the new Yale International Center for Finance—its director, William Goetzmann, as well as Zhiwu Chen, Roger Ibbotson, Ivo Welch, and Jeffrey Wurgler—is also acknowledged. Roger, who is currently giving talks entitled “Dow 100,000” and predicting a brilliant future for the stock market, has been a willing foil for my ideas. Support from my colleagues at Case Shiller Weiss, Inc.—its president, Allan Weiss, as well as Karl Case, Neel Krishnaswami, and Terry Loebs—is much appreciated. As a team, they are attempting to put into practice some of the improvements to our society’s risk management institutions that I describe at the end of this book. I am grateful to the Russell Sage Foundation for sponsoring the behavioral ﬁnance workshops that Richard Thaler and I have been organizing for the past ten years at the National Bureau of Economic Research. The term behavioral ﬁnance refers to research on ﬁnancial markets that takes into account the details of human behavior, including human psychology and sociology. This book beneﬁts immeasurably from the work of the many scholars in the emerging ﬁeld of behavioral ﬁnance, which is now beginning to take a solid place in university ﬁnance departments. ACKN O WL E D G ME N TS xxi The U.S. National Science Foundation has supported much of my basic research on ﬁnancial markets. Their continuing support of my work for over twenty years now has enabled me to focus attention on issues independent of ﬁnancial pressures. I am also grateful to Brad Barber, Scott Boorman, David Colander, Ray Fair, Peter Garber, Jeffrey Garten, Trevor Greetham, Stefan Krieger, Ricky Lam, Benoit Mercereau, Stephen Morris, William Nordhaus, John Rey, Colin Robertson, and Mark Warshawsky for helpful discussions, and to my assistant Carol Copeland and typist Glena Ames for much help. Yoshiro Tsutsui of Osaka University and Fumiko Kon-Ya of the Japanese Securities Research Institute have collaborated with me for the last dozen years on questionnaire survey research exploring investor attitudes in Japan as well as the United States. Help from Josephine Rinaldi and Walt Smietana at CompuMail has been much appreciated. I should certainly also thank the numerous investors who have taken the time to ﬁll out questionnaires for me. To my wife, Virginia Shiller, who is a clinical psychologist, I owe fundamental gratitude for getting me really interested in psychology and convincing me of its importance in economics. She has given the most careful reading and criticism to the entire book and has helped me greatly in articulating my ideas. She also kept the home ﬁres burning while I spent long days and nights working.

Stock markets dropped precipitously. In Japan, the Nikkei index dropped 3.2%; in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng dropped 2.9%; and in Germany, the DAX dropped 4%. In London, the FT-SE 100 index was down 4% at one point during the day, and in the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.3% near the beginning of trading. The words irrational exuberance quickly became Greenspan’s most famous quote—a catch phrase for everyone wh
