Chapter 8, we’ll see how he went about it. Gillette’s razor blade business is a prime beneficiary of globalization. Typically, Gillette begins with low-end blades that have lower margins and over time introduces improved shaving systems with higher 54 T H E W A R R E N B U F F E T T W AY margins. The company stands to benefit not only from increasing unit sales but from steadily improving profit margins as well. Gillette’s future appears bright. “It’s pleasant to go to bed every night,” says Buffett, “knowing there are 2.5 billion males in the world who will have to shave in the morning.”13 The Washington Post Company The Washington Post Company today is a media conglomerate with operations in newspaper publishing, television broadcasting, cable television systems, magazine publishing, and the provision of educational services. The newspaper division publishes the Washington Post, the Everett (Washington) Herald, and the Gazette Newspapers, a group of 39 weekly papers. The television broadcasting division owns six television stations located in Detroit, Miami, Orlando, Houston, San Antonio, and Jacksonville, Florida. The cable television systems division provides cable and digital video services to more than 1.3 billion subscribers. The magazine division publishes Newsweek, with domestic circulation of over 3 million and over 600,000 internationally. In addition to the four major divisions, the Washington Post Company owns the Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Centers, a large network of schools that prepare students for college admission tests and professional licensing exams. Best known for its original program that helps high school students do well on Scholastic Aptitude Tests, Kaplan has aggressively expanded its operations in recent years. It now includes after-school classes for grades K-12, the world’s only accredited online law school, test-prep materials for engineers and CFAs, and campusbased schools with programs in business, finance, technology, health, and other professions. In 2003, Kaplan’s sales totaled $838 million, making it a significant element in the Post Company. The company owns 28 percent of Cowles Media, which publishes the Minneapolis Star Tribune, several military newspapers, and 50 percent of the Los Angeles-Washington News Service. Today, the Washington Post Company is an $8 billion company generating $3.2 billion in annual sales. Its accomplishments are especially impressive when you consider that seventy years ago, the company was in one business—publishing a newspaper. In 1931, the Washington Post was one of five dailies competing for readers. Two years later, the Post, unable to pay for its newsprint, was Buying a Business 55 placed in receivership. That summer, the company was sold at auction to satisfy creditors. Eugene Meyer, a millionaire financier, bought the paper for $825,000. For the next two decades, he supported the operation until it turned a profit. Management of the paper passed to Philip Graham, a brilliant Harvard-educated lawyer who had married Meyer’s daughter Katherine. In 1954, Phil Graham convinced Eugene Meyer to purchase a rival newspaper, the Times-Herald. Later, Graham purchased Newsweek magazine and two television stations before his tragic death in 1963. It is Phil Graham who is credited with transforming the Washington Post from a single newspaper into a media and communications company. After Phil Graham’s death, control of the Washington Post passed to his wife, Katherine. Although she had no experience managing a major corporation, she quickly distinguished herself by confronting difficult business issues. Katherine Graham realized that to be successful the company would need a decision maker not a caretaker. “I quickly learned that things don’t stand still,” she said. “You have to make decisions.”14 Two decisions that had a pronounced impact on the Washington Post were hiring Ben Bradlee as managing editor of the newspaper and then inviting Warren Buffett to become a director of the company. Bradlee encouraged Katherine Graham to publish the Pentagon Papers and to pursue the Watergate investigation, which earned the Washington Post a reputation for prizewinning journalism. Buffett taught Katherine Graham how to run a successful business. Buffett first met Katherine Graham in 1971. At that time, Buffett owned stock in the New Yorker. Hearing that the magazine might be for sale, he asked Katherine Graham whether the Washington Post would be interested in purchasing it. Although the sale never materialized, Buffett came away very much impressed with the publisher of the Washington Post. That same year, Katherine Graham decided to take the Washington Post public. Two classes of stock were created. Class A common stock elected a majority of the board of directors, thus effectively controlling the company. Class A stock was, and still is, held by the Graham family. Class B stock elected a minority of the board of directors. In June 1971, the Washington Post issued 1,354,000 shares of class B stock. Remarkably, two days later, despite threats from the federal government, Katherine Graham gave Ben Bradlee permission to publish the Pentagon Papers. 56 T H E W A R R E N B U F F E T T W AY For the next two years, while business at the paper was improving, the mood on Wall Street was turning gloomy. In early 1973, the Dow Jones Industrial Average began to slide. The Washington Post share price was slipping as well; by May, it was down 14 points to $23. That same month, IBM stock declined over 69 points, gold broke through $100 an ounce, the Federal Reserve boosted the discount rate to 6 percent, and the Dow fell 18 points—its biggest loss in three years. And all the while, Warren Buffett was quietly buying shares in the Washington Post (see Figure 4.3). By June, he had purchased 467,150 shares at an average price of $22.75, worth $10,628,000. Katherine Graham was initially unnerved at the idea of a nonfamily member owning so much Post stoc
