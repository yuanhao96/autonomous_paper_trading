As monstrous as this indebtedness was, it was by no means the worst of Long-Term's problems. The fund had entered into thousands of derivative contracts, which billion in assets, had endlessly it intertwined every bank on Wall Street. These with market prices, covered an astroworth of exposure. If Long-Term defaulted, all of the banks in the room would be left holding one side of a contract for which the other side no longer existed.In other words, they would be exposed to tremendous--and contracts, essentially nomical sum--more side than collateral $2 trillion Undoubtedly, untenable--risks. bank rushed to escapeits its bets on from now there one-sided would be obligations as every and tried to sell a frenzy Long-Term.
