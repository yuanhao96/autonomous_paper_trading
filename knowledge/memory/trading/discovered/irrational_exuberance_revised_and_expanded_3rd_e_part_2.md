Chapter 1, describes a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, in a sort of psychological epidemic. That seems to be the core of the meaning of the word as it is most consistently used. xiv PR EFAC E T O T HE T HIR D EDIT ION Implicit in this definition is a suggestion about why it is so difficult for “smart money” to profit by betting against bubbles: the psychological contagion promotes a mindset that justifies the price increases, so that participation in the bubble might be called almost rational. But it is not rational. The story in every country is different, reflecting its own news, which does not always jibe with news in other countries. For example, the current story in Colombia appears to be that the country’s government, now under the well-regarded management of President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, has brought down inflation and interest rates to developed-country levels while all but eliminating the threat posed by the FARC rebels, thereby injecting new vitality into the Colombian economy. That is a good enough story to drive a housing bubble. New era stories drive high expectations for investing returns but not necessarily high confidence. The high expectations during the upswing of a bubble may be more in the form of a sort of wishful thinking rather than an expression of confidence. In bubble times, there seems to be a tendency for complacency, as an aspect of social psychology, even if people haven’t individually concluded that there is no risk. Indeed, once you draw their attention to the risks, people are not so confident during a growing bubble. Figure 5.4, which plots investor valuation confidence, was actually exceptionally low at the all-time U.S. stock market peak in early 2000. People were certainly aware at some level of risks. Moreover, in a survey of homebuyers that Karl Case and I have been conducting over the years, we pose the following question to recent homebuyers directly: “Buying a house in this area today involves: 1. A great deal of risk; 2. Some risk; 3. Little or no risk.” The answers are puzzling. In 2004, when the housing market was showing its fastest price increases, only 19% said “little or no risk.” It is not as if everyone thought that “home prices can never fall” during the bubble, though they are often accused of having thought that. In the 2009 survey, at the depths of the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the percentage of respondents choosing that option was actually lower, at 17.2%.4 During bubbles, it seems that the psychological ambience is rather one of public inattention to the thought that prices could fall, rather than firm belief that they can never fall. The new era stories are not new strongly held convictions—they are merely ideas foremost in people’s minds that serve as justification both for the actions of others and of themselves. Because bubbles are essentially subtle social-psychological phenomena, they are, by their very nature, difficult to control. Regulatory action since the financial crisis might diminish bubbles in the future, but it is yet to be seen whether such actions will be sufficient. PRE FA C E T O T H E TH IRD E D ITIO N xv Liquid public markets for home prices do not exist that would allow skeptics of housing bubbles to take short positions against these bubbles, which would, if it were possible, have the effect of incorporating their doubts into the market prices. As we discuss in
