will you get out of the trade? Believe it or not, there are many traders who do not use a stop at all. They are fearful that the brokers/market makers will see their stop and run Ule price to hit all the stops. That is true in some cases especially i f you are trading lower time frames. However, what will happen to your account if a news announcement comes and moves price dras­ tically in a matter of milliseconds? With the use of an automated INTRODUCTION trading system with the latest technology, mUlions of trades can now be executed in less Ulan one second! Do you want to be on Ule other side of the trade? Notice, I have used the word ustop" compared to "stop loss." In my mentoring, the biggest obstacle for someone to overcome is the psychology of the word "loss" in "stop loss." The word "loss" has a negative meaning that people fear and try to avoid. When it does occur, Ule person's state of mind is altered to a point where logical thinking no longer occurs and "panic" sets in. Many people believe they do not panic when Uley have a loss but there are many forms of panic. Here is a great analogy to prove the point: In elementary school, there are two boys, the first boy's name is Ben and the second boy's name is Frank. Frank has a perfect atten­ dance and is proud of his accomplishment and strives every day to make sure he maintains that status. One day, Frank was walking to school as he nonna{f.y does each day. As he was walking, another boy named Ben approaches Frank. Ben hits Frank in the stomach for no apparent reason and then walks away. Frank does not under­ stand why Ben did that so he does not take any action. The second day Frank walks to school and runs into Ben again. Again, Ben hits Frank in the stomach and then walks away. The third day comes and Frank, who is afraid of getting hit, decides to take another route to school in order to avoid Ben. Frank avoids Ben but he arrives to school late. The route he had to take was a route that took longer than he expected. His perfect attendance was ruined in one day due to Ben! So what is the moral? Frank got hit once but kept on follow­ ing his plan to go to school as he normally does. When the second time occurred, he was cautious but not prepared because he did not think it would happen again but it did. The third time, he re­ acted but he lost his perfect attendance. He was so worried about Ben he forgot about this periect attendance, which was important to him. When trading, if you view the word "stop" as a loss, it is a neg­ ative state of mind. If it occurs once, twice, three times, and so on, sooner or later it will alter your slate of mind to a point where you will start to react to it instead of following your "game plan." If you get stopped out of a trade that meallS you "luere wrong. Remember, the goal is to have a trading strategy that minimizes losses when you are wrong and maximizes profits when you are right. Notice I said minimize not none? Usi.ng the word "none" is not
