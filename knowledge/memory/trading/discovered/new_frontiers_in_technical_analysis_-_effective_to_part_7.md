Chapter 1 is the tracking and measurement of the use and growth of charts and technical indicators in different regions of the world. Another observation is the growth rate of the number of market participants specializing in technical analysis. In 2010, the Market Technician’s Association announced there were more than 1,000 active Chartered Market Technicians (CMTs) residing in 76 countries, representing a 100 percent increase in only four years. Yet another measure is the growing interest in and reliance on the development and implementation of innovative technical tools and strategies that capitalize on existing methods, such as those presented by the contributors to this book. The bridge between fundamental and technical analysis continues to strengthen and the sophistication of each continues to develop. About a century ago, Charles Dow, who was a journalist, entrepreneur, and technician, created some of the world’s most popular equity indices, which are relied on today by all market participants. About 30 years ago, the fundamental term relative strength had only one meaning, until the publication of the Relative Strength Index by established market technician J. Welles Wilder. The xi xii Preface theories of fundamental analysis and technical analysis are evolving together and affecting each other at rates faster than ever before. Therefore, a goal of this book is to properly document and share the gains of this evolution. This book comprises contributions from ﬁve individuals who have spent most of their careers, if not all, studying the ﬁnancial markets through a “technical” lens with the goal of identifying, developing, and implementing effective trading and investment strategies. These strategies attempt to capitalize on the experiences in their careers and explain how existing market actions will impact the future. Their methods are based on the existing body of knowledge of Technical Analysis, and have evolved to support and appeal to technical, fundamental, and quantitative analysts alike. I view the contributors as accomplished market participants who do everything they can to continually adapt to the modern-day securities exchange industry. They are constantly modifying and reﬁning their methodic approaches to the markets in order to achieve success, and I feel privileged to be a part of the sharing of their strategies. These ﬁve individuals bring with them a combined 150 years of market experience. Their methods, at some point in time, were likely somewhat simplistic, such as the application of moving averages, overbought and oversold momentum indicators, trending indicators, volume analysis, and so forth. We could ask them to recall how they would use these studies, as I’m certain they remember from their earlier days, but this has been done many times with experienced market professionals. Rather,
