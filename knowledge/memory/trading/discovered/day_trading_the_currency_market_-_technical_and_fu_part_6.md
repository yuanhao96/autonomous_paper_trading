Chapter 7, traders should try to range trade only when the conditions for a range-bound market are met. The most important condition (but certainly not the only one) is to look for ADX to be less than 25 and ideally trending downward. FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS One of the most widely overlooked yet lucrative areas of trading is market structure. Developing a keen understanding of micro structure and dynamics allows traders to gain an unbelievable advantage and is probably one of the most reliable tactic for profiting from intraday fluctuations. Developing a feel for and understanding of market dynamics is key to profitably taking advantage of short-term fluctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary influence of intraday price action is order flow. Given the fact that most individual traders are not privy to sell-side bank order flow, day traders looking to profit from short-term fluctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones where large order flows should be triggered. This technique is very efficient for intraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker. When trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off of every support or resistance level and expect to be profitable. The key to successful intraday trading requires that we be more selective and enter only at those levels where a reaction is more likely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round numbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent numbers where the last two digits are zeros—for example, 107.00 in the USD/JPY or 1.2800 in the EUR/USD. After noticing how many times a currency pair would bounce off of double zero support or resistance levels intraday despite the underlying trend, we have noticed that the bounces are usually much bigger and more relevant than rallies off other areas. This type of reaction is perfect for intraday FX traders as it gives them the opportunity to make 50 pips while risking only 15 to 20 pips. Implementing this methodology is not difficult, but it does require individual traders to develop a solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind why this methodology works is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order flow have a very distinct advantage over other market participants. The banks' order books give them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers will often use this strategic information themselves to put on short-term positions for their own accounts. Market participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around the same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round numbers, traders will cluster their lake-profit orders at the round number. The reason why this occurs is because traders are humans and humans tend to think in round numbers. As a result, take-profit orders have a very high tendency of being placed at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a nonstop continuous market, speculators also use stop and limit orders much more frequently than in other markets. Large banks with access to conditional order flow, like stops and limits, actively seek to exploit these clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The strategy of fading the 81 double zeros attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers and basically positions traders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level. This trade is most profitable when there are other technical indicators that confirm the significance or the double zero level. Strategy Rules Long 1. First, locate a currency pair that is trading well below its intraday 20-period simple moving average on a 10- or 15-minute chart. 2. Next, enter a long position several pips below the figure (no more than 10). 3. Place an initial protective stop no more than 20 pips below the entry price. 4. When the position is profitable by double the amount that you risked, close half of the position and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor. Short 1. First, locate a currency pair that is trading well above its intraday 20-period simple moving average on a 10- or 15-minute chart. 2. Next, short the currency pair several pips above the figure (no more than 10). 3. Place an initial protective stop no more than 20 pips above the entry price. 4. When the position is profitable by double the amount that you risked, close half of the position and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor. Market Conditions This strategy works best when the move happens without any major economic number as a catalyst in other words, in quieter market conditions. It is used most successfully for pairs with tighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy does work for the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stops are relatively tight. Further Optimization The psychologically important round number levels have even greater significance if they coincide with a key technical level. Therefore the strategy tends to have an even higher probability of success when other important support or resistance levels converge at the figure, such as moving averages, key Fibonacci levels, and Bollinger bands, just to name a few. Examples So let us take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The first example that we will go over is Figure 8.8, a 15-minute chart of the EUR/USD. According to the rules of the strategy, we see that the EUR/USD broke down and was trading well below its 20-period moving average. Prices continued to trend lower, moving toward 1.2800, which is our double zero number. In accordance with the rules, we place an entry order a few pips below the breakeven number at 1.2795. Our 82 order is
