Chapter 8, “The Organized Trader”). If you have the willpower to repeat this process daily for several months, then you have the discipline for successful trading with real money. Still, there is no substitute for trading with real money, because it engages emotions more than any paper trade. It is better to learn by putting on very small real trades than paper trades. TRIPLE SCREEN UPDATE One of the most pleasant encounters that occur several times each year is when a trader comes up to me at some conference and tells me how he started trading for a living after studying my book or participating in a Camp. At that point, he may be living and trading on a mountaintop, and as often as not he owns the mountaintop. I noticed long ago that half-way through our conversation these people become slightly apologetic. They tell me they use Triple Screen, but not exactly the way I taught it. They may have modified an indicator, added another screen, substituted a tool, and so forth. Whenever I hear that, I know I am talking to a winner. First of all, I tell them they owe their success primarily to themselves. I did not teach them any differently than the dozens of others in the same class. Winners have the discipline to take what is offered and use it to succeed. Second, I see their apology for having changed some aspects of my system as an indication of their winning attitude. To benefit from a system, you must test its parameters and fine-tune them until that system becomes your own, even though originally it was developed by someone else. Winning takes discipline, discipline comes from confi- TRADING 129 dence, and the only system in which you can have confidence is the one you have tested on your own data and adapted to your own style. I developed the Triple Screen trading system in the mid-1980s and first presented it to the public in 1986 in an article in Futures magazine. I updated it in Trading for a Living and several videos. Here I will review it, focusing on recent enhancements. What is a trading system? What’s the difference between a method, a system, and a technique? A method is a general philosophy of trading. For example; trade with the trend, buy when the trend is up, and sell after it tops out. Or—buy undervalued markets, go long near historical support levels, and sell after resistance zones have been reached. A system is a set of rules for implementing a method. For example, if our method is to follow trends, then the system may buy when a multi-week moving average turns up and sell when a daily moving average turns down (get in slow, get out fast). Or—buy when the weekly MACDHistogram ticks up and sell after it ticks down. A technique is a specific rule for entering or exiting trades. For example, when a system gives a buy signal, the technique could be to buy when prices exceed the high of the previous day or if prices make a new low during the day but close near the high. The method of Triple Screen is to analyze markets in several timeframes and use both the trend-following indicators and oscillators. We make a strategic decision to trade long or short using trend-following indicators on long-term charts. We make tactical decisions to enter or exit using oscillators on shorter-term charts. The original method has not changed, but the system—the exact choice of indicators—has evolved over the years, as have the techniques. Triple Screen examines each potential trade using three screens or tests. Each screen uses a different timeframe and indicators. These screens filter out many trades that seem attractive at first. Triple Screen promotes a careful and cautious approach to trading. Conflicting Indicators Technical indicators help identify trends or turns more objectively than chart patterns. Just keep in mind that when you change indicator parameters, you influence their signals. Be careful not to fiddle with indicators until they tell you what you want to hear. 130 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING We can divide all indicators into three major groups: Trend-following indicators help identify trends. Moving averages, MACD lines, Directional system, and others rise when the markets are rising, decline when markets fall, and go flat when markets enter trading ranges. Oscillators help catch turning points by identifying overbought and oversold conditions. Envelopes or channels, Force Index, Stochastic, Elder-ray, and others show when rallies or declines outrun themselves and are ready to reverse. Miscellaneous indicators help gauge the mood of the market crowd. Bullish Consensus, Commitments of Traders, New High–New Low Index, and others reflect the general levels of bullishness or bearishness in the market. Different groups of indicators often give conflicting signals. Trendfollowing indicators may turn up, telling us to buy, while oscillators become overbought, telling us to sell. Trend-following indicators may turn down, giving sell signals, while oscillators become oversold, giving buy signals. It is easy to fall into the trap of wishful thinking and start following those indicators whose message you like. A trader must set up a system that takes all groups of indicators into account and handles their contradictions. Conflicting Timeframes An indicator can call an uptrend and a downtrend in the same stock on the same day. How can this be? A moving average may rise on a weekly chart, giving a buy signal, but fall on a daily chart, giving a sell signal. It may rally on an hourly chart, telling us to go long, but sink on a 10minute chart, telling us to short. Which of those signals should we take? Amateurs reach for the obvious. They grab a single timeframe, most often daily, apply their indicators and ignore other timeframes. This works only until a major move swells up from the weeklies or a sharp spike erupts from the hourly charts and flips their trade upside down. Whoever said that ignorance was bliss was not a trader. People who have lost money with daily charts often
