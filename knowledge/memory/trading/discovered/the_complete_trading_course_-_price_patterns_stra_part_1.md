HG4529.R67 2011 332.63′2042–dc22 2010032311 To my parents, George and Debby, for without the life-long support, encouragement, and lifelessons you both taught me, none of this would be remotely possible. Preface When you first look at a stock chart as an opportunity to make money, where do you start? How do you classify all the conflicting signals , cut through the noise, and get straight to the point of what matters most? How do you structure your analysis? And when you find what you think could be a trading opportunity, how do you enter, manage, and exit the trade most efficiently? The Complete Trading Course answers these common questions of traders from all experience levels and provides you a specific pathway for analyzing your chart to find specific trading opportunities. These opportunities are built on time-tested price principles that winning traders have used for many years, but have been buried under the information overload of today's high-speed, indicator-driven markets. Building from a foundation of price principles that guide your analysis, the book then overlays specific strategies onto the developing structure from insights in candlestick charts (showing not just the pattern, but how the pattern forms and its importance in assessing turns in price), price patterns, and Fibonacci retracements, all of which fit into the specific context of the life cycle of a price move on any timeframe. Knowing where the chart exists in the life cycle of a price move reveals what strategies are most effective and what indicators reveal the best setups, which guide your specific decisions on where to enter, place stops, play for a specific price target, or hold for a larger gain as you monitor open positions as new data emerges on the chart in real time. Knowing how to identify trades based on price trend, momentum, and volatility are all foundation concepts which are covered in detail in the first part of the book. The section on edge reveals specifics of trade execution tactics geared to your unique personality, which is not covered in most trading books that reveal “buy here, sell there” strategies that do not take into account the unique experiences and personality of the trader putting on the position. If you do not understand why you are entering a trade, you will almost certainly not be successful in that trade, as you will lack the confidence and edge necessary to recognize a proper opportunity, manage it in real time, and exit the position properly without emotion negatively affecting your decision. This book specifically addresses the importance of combining objective chart information with your understanding and experience; as such, the confidence you have in your strategies and methods will combat the natural tendency to enter when you feel most confident and exit when you feel the most pain, both of which allow emotions to erode your accuracy and monetary trading edge. I wrote this book from my combined experience and education as a Chartered Market Technician and trader of many markets and strategies; I wish this book had existed when I began my journey as a trader, as it would have saved me countless hours of wasted time and effort. What separates today's traders from those 50 years ago is the sheer amount of information, webinars, seminars, books, courses, blogs, web sites, ebooks, and so on that inundate the new trader with too much information, and too many voices saying their methods are the best. Lured by the promise of instant riches, a new trader buys a new indicator or attends a single expensive seminar, only to find the information too complicated to apply, or worse, absolutely ineffective in a real-time, fast-paced tradi
