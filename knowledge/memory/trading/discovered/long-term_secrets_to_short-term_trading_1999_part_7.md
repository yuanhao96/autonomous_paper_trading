Chapter 5 The Theory of Short-Term Trading In the short term, theories work, but in the long term, give way to reality Now that you have an understanding of how markets move from point to point and the basic strategy of how to best take advantage of these swings it is time to examine the theory of what we are doing so I can then take you back to practical application. Our basic concept or working theory is that something causes explosive market moves. These explosions put the market into a trend phase, and these trends, for our purpose, last from 1 to 5 days in most markets. Our object is to get aboard as close to the start of this explosion as possible. Which gives rise to the questions, "What causes these explosions in market activity, when are they most apt to occur, and is there anything here we can use to pin down the time and place of these moves>? " Succinctly stated, those are the problems I have dealt with most of m, life. Long ago, I recognized that if I could not identify a problem there was no way on earth I could find its solution. You now know the problems so let's look for some solutions. Let me hastily add that I do not have all the answers to this gigantic puzzle. There is nothing like losing to bring you to your senses, to teach you that you are not so damned smart, that you need more education. I still have losses, plenty of them. so I too, still need more education. And always will. The biggest "cause" of these moves is probably news. But we have trouble trading on news because, first, the news can change as quickly and as unpredictably as the weather. News, or changes in world events and marketplaces, can be random; thus, the markets wobble around from one unknown news event to the next. 75 76 The drunken sailor analogy mathematicians have used is most likely due to news knocking prices back and forth. Second, we may be the last guy on the food chain getting such news so we receive it too late. Third, there is nothing we can look at or observe that tells us what specific future news might be. Fourth, my years of trading strongly suggest that those who are close to the news usually position themselves prior to the announcement. (Note: There is not one group taking advantage of news; the group varies from source to source.) Bankers might have inside news about the T-Bond market, but not on Cattle, whereas feedlot operators might have that data, but nothing on Bonds. There is not an Illuminati controlling all news sources. While Mel Gibson's character Jerry Phillips was right on in the movie Conspiracy Theory, do not extend that theory to the markets. While I was writing this book, a book about some of my archeological exploits, The Gold of Exodus, by Howard Blum (New York: Simon & Schuster), was discussed in several magazine and newspaper articles. In one of them, where I lived was stated incorrectly as was my occupation, my age, the type of car I drive, and my description of what the book is all about' In short, if I can't believe what I read about myself from a reporter who personally interviewed me, I suggest you probably can't trust much of what is written about Orangejuice, Oats, and Oil. The supposedly prestigious Wall Street Journal is no exception. In early 1998, they told readers their source inside the Federal Reserve System was certain the Fed Open Market Committee was about to raise interest rates. Six weeks later when the Fed released their notes on the meeting, we learned the truth, they had voted 11 to 1 to not raise rates! On at least two occasions, reporters of the Wall Street journal have been found to be touting stocks they, themselves, had already acquired a position in. Television is not exempt from this same problem; CNBC's lead "Inside source" Dan Dorffinan is no longer on air for the same allegations of misleading viewers. A few years back, even Ralph Nader was caught, or rather his mother was, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, selling short stocks in General Motors and a tire company just before Nader attacked them with his consumer complaint law-suits. So what else can we look at if we can't really examine news' "Price action! Charts” scream technicians and most short-term swing players. The nice thing about price action, as reflected on charts, is that there are plenty of things to look at and analyze, the most common being (1) price patterns, (2) indicators based on price action, and (3) the trend or momentum of price. Not so common, and the fourth one of my big tools, is the relationship one market may have on another. Remember the S&P 500 77 system and how much better it was when we required that bonds be in an uptrend? That is an example of market relationships that I discuss in detail a little later on. Our final and fifth set of data to key off of comes from following the crowd most often found to be wrong. On a short-term basis, the great unwashed public trader is a net loser. Always has been, always will be. The figures I have heard bandied about over the years are that 80 percent of the public lose all their money, be they stock or commodity traders. Thus coppering their wagers should lead us to those short-term explosions and profits. There are various ways to measure the public; these are called sentiment indicators. The two best ones I know of are surveys of the public done by Jake Bernstein and Market Vane. For short-term traders, I prefer Jake's because he actually calls 50 traders after the close each day to find out if they are bullish or bearish on any given market. Since these are short-term traders, and by definition usually wrong, we can use them as a guide of when not to be a buyer or seller. I will not use them exclusively as an indicator to buy or sell, but as a tool that should not be in agreement with my own hand-selected trade. If the public is excessive in their selling, I don't want to be a seller along with them. I may not always fade the public, but I sure don't want them on my side of the table. Market
