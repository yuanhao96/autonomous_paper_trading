CHAPTER 2 INTRODUCTION TO THE FOREX 23 the Forex market. The spread is the difference between the buy price and the sell price of a specific currency. Envision attending an auction where there are several buyers for a particular item. The auctioneer hopes to sell the item for $10.00 and has asked for bids. One bidder offers $4.00. The difference between the $4.00 bid and $10.00 asking price is $6.00, which is called the spread. As bidding gets closer to the asking price, the spread tightens up. When the bidding gets to $9.95, there is a $0.05 spread, and when the bidders agrees to buy it for $10.00 and the seller agrees to sell it, you have a transaction. There are spreads between all currency pairs that are traded, and they average 3 to 6 price interest points, or pips, on the major world currencies (which are considered to be the U.S. dollar [USD], the British pound [GBP], the Japanese yen [JPY], the European euro [EUR], and the Swiss franc [CHF]). The value of a pip averages about $10.00. Currencies from small countries are called off-brand currencies and can have spreads as much as 500 to 1,000 pips. The broker retains the spread, which is the difference between the buy and the sell price. This is done when a trader enters a trade and upon execution of the trade the spread, should the trade not go your way, is deducted from the trader’s account. Example: If the sell price is 4 pips lower, or $40.00 less, than the buy price, and you buy a currency and immediately go to sell it without any movement in your favor, you would lose $40.00, or 4 pips. To break even, the market would need to move up 4 pips in your direction. To make a profit, the market would need to move more than 4 pips in your direction. HOW DO TRADERS GET PAID? Price interest points, commonly known as pips, are usually expressed in decimals. Depending on the pair of currencies being traded, pips are usually the last numbers of the decimal. As shown in the EUR/USD example of Figure 2-1, pips are measured when the fourth digit after the decimal point moves up or down. A trader’s financial reward is measured in pips, which are then converted into dollars. Most traders on the Forex trade with what is called leverage. This is borrowing or using a broker’s money to trade. You acquire leverage by posting a bond or a deposit with a Forex broker who then allows you to trade using the broker’s money. When a trader executes a trade on the Forex, the trader is buying or selling currency in units referred to as lots (which is a set quantity of money). There are typically two types of lots that traders will trade. A $100,000 unit is called a regular lot, and a 24 THE 10 ESSENTIALS OF FOREX TRADING FIGURE 2-1 EUR/USD (One Hour Chart) Time Versus Price $10,000 unit is called a mini-lot. When you buy and sell a regular lot, you get paid $10.00 a pip versus $1.00 a pip on the mini-lot. For example, if we were buying or exchanging one currency lot on the EUR/USD currency pair at the exchange rate of USD $1.28 for every 1 euro, or 1.2800 price point (see Figure 2-1), we would enter the market at that point. You will see that the currency moved in our favor to 1.2840, at which point we decided to exit the market, selling our lot for a profit of 40 pips. To equate the 40 pips with money value, remember the following: 1 pip = approximately $10.00 on a $100,000 transaction or $1.00 on a mini-lot transaction. If we made 40 pips in profit on this transaction, we would have made 40 pips ⫻ $10.00 = $400.00 on a $100,000 account or 40 pips ⫻ $1.00 = $40.00 on a $10,000 account. The average minimum deposit for trading with leverage is 1 percent, which means that for every $100,000 lot you trade, you must have $1,000.00 in your margin trading account. For mini-lots, you will need a minimum of $100.00 in your margin trading account on deposit. Trading can be a worthy full-time profession or a great way to earn secondary income. Either way, you will need to learn the three basic skills of trading as you watch price movement against time.
