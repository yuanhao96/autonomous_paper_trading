Chapter 9 “Trading for a Living.” S E C T I O N T H R E E LET’S TRADE: CASE STUDIES AND QUESTIONS LET’S TRADE The longer you trade, the more you learn—practice will make you a better trader. Be sure to put on many small trades and carefully document every entry and exit. Good records allow you to learn from experience. Trading small will help you keep emotions in check. You will have plenty of time to increase your trading size once you become a competent trader. Remember this paragraph from Come Into My Trading Room: Keeping good records is the single most important contribution to your success. If you scrupulously maintain records, review them, and learn from them, your performance will improve. If, at the same time, your money management is in place to ensure survival during the learning process, you’re sure to become a success. This chapter of the Study Guide offers you an opportunity to practice making trading decisions and keeping records. Look at the charts in this chapter as if you saw them in your trader’s diary. Mark up chart patterns and indicator signals, and write down your comments on the most important points. Make your trading decision and then turn to the Answers chapter to compare your notes with mine and grade your performance. There are many ways to reach a trading decision. Some serious traders use fundamental analysis, others technical, some combine both, while gamblers trade “from the gut.” I like to be aware of the key fundamentals, but my favorite method is technical analysis. Price, time, and volume reflect actions of all market participants—smart and dumb, 143 144 CASE STUDIES disciplined and gamblers, rich and poor, long-term and short-term oriented. Prices and indicators are the footprints of bulls and bears. Let us practice reading those footprints in order to find our way. The charts in this section were printed in December 2001, not long after the disaster of September 11th in New York. In stressful times like these, when fundamentals shift rapidly, technical analysis really shines. How to Work with These Case Studies You will see three charts for each trade—two for the entry and one for the exit. For the entry, you will have a weekly and a daily chart. The weekly chart will show about a year and a half of history, a 26-week EMA (solid), a 13-week EMA (dotted), and MACD-Histogram. The daily chart, ending on the same day, will show several months of history, the 22-day and the 13-day EMAs (solid and dotted), a 2-day Force Index, and MACD-Histogram. For exit and reentry decisions, you will see an updated daily chart that will, in addition to the above, show a trading channel centered around the long EMA. These charts feature some of my favorite indicators, although many others could be used. It would impossible to show all important indicators in a study guide, especially since serious traders always change their sets of technical tools. My main goal here is to demonstrate the need for using multiple timeframes—making a strategic decision on the weekly chart and tactical choices on the daily chart. I also want to illustrate the need for combining several indicators—trend-following and oscillators—to evaluate different aspects of market behavior and make rational trading decisions. It is your job to find, mark, and document at least two important trading signals on each chart. You will receive a point for each correctly marked signal and bonus points for identifying additional trading signals. Be sure to document each step that you take. There are eight sets of charts, covering eight trades. Begin by working through an entry in one market, and then grade your performance on that entry. Afterward, work through an exit and grade your performance again, using rating scales in the Answers section. If you are satisfied with your performance, move on to the next trade and repeat this process. If you find that you have done poorly in a trade, return to Come QUESTIONS 145 Into My Trading Room and reread the relevant chapters before going any further. This process will put you miles ahead of amateurs and gamblers who jump into the market with both feet, chasing a quick buck— and get taken out feet first. Education, record keeping, and caution are essential for your long-term success, which is the only success worth having in the financial markets. Please do not try to complete all eight exercises in a single day. Give yourself enough time to think, reflect, reread relevant chapters, and review other charts on your screen. You can take more than a week to work through these exercises. Here is the recommended sequence of steps as you move through eight trades: 1. Look at the Entry Question page, which shows two unmarked charts—weekly and a daily. 2. Mark two or more trading messages on each chart; make an entry decision and document it. 3. Go to the Entry Answer page for that trade and grade your entry performance. If the grade is satisfactory (above the pass point), proceed as directed below; otherwise, return to Come Into My Trading Room and study the relevant chapters. 4. Go to the Exit Question page, which shows an updated unmarked daily chart. Quickly cover it with a sheet of paper. 5. Gently move the sheet from left to right, until you uncover the vertical arrow marking the entry into the trade; from that day onward, move the sheet to the right very slowly, one day at a time, stopping after you uncover each day. 6. Whenever you see an exit point, based on chart or indicator signals, mark it; whenever you see a likely reentry point, mark it also. Most charts have more than one exit and reentry point. 7. Once you reach the right edge of the chart, go to the Exit Answer page and rate your performance. If the grade is satisfactory (above the pass point), proceed as directed below; otherwise, return to Come Into My Trading Room and study the relevant chapters. 8. Proceed to the next trade and repeat the process. 146 CASE STUDIES Technical analysis is partly a science a
