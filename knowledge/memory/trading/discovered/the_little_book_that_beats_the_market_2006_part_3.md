Chapter 1, it will be your belief in the overwhelming logic of the magic formula that will make the formula work for you in the long run. So let’s try to understand how the magic formula chooses good companies at bargain prices. The formula starts with a list of the largest 3,500 companies available for trading on one of the major U.S. stock exchanges.* It then assigns a rank to those companies, from 1 to 3,500, based on their return on capital. The company whose business had the highest return on capital would be assigned a rank of 1, and the company with the lowest return on capital (probably a company actually losing money) would receive a rank of 3,500. Similarly, the company that had the 232nd best return on capital would be assigned a rank of 232. *Details of this test are provided in the Appendix section (certain financial stocks and utilities are excluded from our stock universe). [54] J O E L G R E E N B LAT T Next, the formula follows the same procedure, but this time, the ranking is done using earnings yield. The company with the highest earnings yield is assigned a rank of 1, and the company with the lowest earnings yield receives a rank of 3,500. Likewise, the company with the 153rd highest earnings yield out of our list of 3,500 companies would be assigned a rank of 153. Finally, the formula just combines the rankings. The formula isn’t looking for the company that ranks best on return on capital or the one with the highest earnings yield. Rather, the formula looks for the companies that have the best combination of those two factors. So, a company that ranked 232nd best in return on capital and 153rd highest in earnings yield would receive a combined ranking of 385 (232 + 153). A company that ranked 1st in return on capital but only 1,150th best in earnings yield would receive a combined ranking of 1,151 (1,150 + 1).* If you’re not a numbers person, don’t worry. Just keep in mind that the companies that receive the best combined rankings are the ones that have the best combination of both factors. In this system, the company that had the 232nd best return on capital could outrank the company that ranked 1st in return on capital. Why? Because we could purchase the company that had the *The better combined ranking is, therefore, 385. T H E L I T T L E B O O K T H AT B E ATS T H E M A R K E T [55] 232nd best return on capital (an excellent ranking out of 3,500) for a price low enough to give us a very high earnings yield (153rd cheapest out of 3,500 based on earnings yield). Getting excellent rankings in both categories (though not the top-ranked in either) would be better under this ranking system than being the top-ranked in one category with only a pretty good ranking in the other. Pretty simple, right? But it can’t be this easy! Can a portfolio of 30 or so of the highest-ranked stocks really get such great investment results? Well, consider this. Take a look at the returns that would have been achieved over the last 17 years if we had simply followed the recommendations of the magic formula (see Table 6.1). Oops! This can’t be. The results are just too good! Surely, something must be wrong here. We’ll really have to examine these results very closely. But let’s say we leave that for the next chapter. For now, we can review the short summary and spend some more time enjoying the results from using the magic formula. They appear to be quite satisfactory. Quick Summary 1. Ben Graham had a “magic formula.” Graham figured that purchases that could meet the strict [56] J O E L G R E E N B LAT T TABLE 6.1 Magic Formula Results Magic Formula Market Average* S&P 500 1988 27.1% 24.8% 16.6% 1989 44.6 18.0 31.7 1990 1.7 (16.1) (3.1) 1991 70.6 45.6 30.5 1992 32.4 11.4 7.6 1993 17.2 15.9 10.1 1994 22.0 (4.5) 1.3 1995 34.0 29.1 37.6 1996 17.3 14.9 23.0 1997 40.4 16.8 33.4 1998 25.5 (2.0) 28.6 1999 53.0 36.1 21.0 2000 7.9 (16.8) (9.1) 2001 69.6 11.5 (11.9) 2002 (4.0) (24.2) (22.1) 2003 79.9 68.8 28.7 2004 19.3 17.8 10.9 30.8% 12.3% 12.4% *Note: The “market average” return is an equally weighted index of our 3,500-stock universe. Each stock in the index contributes equally to the return. The S&P 500 index is a market-weighted index of 500 large stocks. Larger stocks (those with the highest market capitalizations) are counted more heavily than smaller stocks. T H E L I T T L E B O O K T H AT B E ATS T H E M A R K E T [57] requirements of his formula were likely to be, on average, bargains—bargains created by Mr. Market’s practically giving away businesses at unreasonably low prices. 2. Today, few companies meet the strict requirements outlined by Graham. 3. We have designed a new magic formula—a formula that seeks to find good companies at bargain prices. 4. The new formula appears to work. In fact, it appears to work too well. 5. Before piling every penny we have into the magic formula, we should probably examine the results more closely. Chapter Seven “IT AIN’T THE THINGS WE DON’T KNOW that get us in trouble,” said Artemus Ward, a nineteenth-century newspaper columnist. “It’s the things we know that ain’t so.” And that, in a nutshell, is our problem. The magic formula looks like it works. In fact, the results are so good there can hardly be any argument. And of course, we want it to work. Who wouldn’t want to make lots of money without trying all that hard? But does the magic formula really work? Sure, all the numbers look good, but do we know where they came from (or who they’ve been with, for that matter)? More important, do we know where they’re going? Even if the formula worked in the past, are we merely learning how to “fight the last war”? Will the formula continue to work in the future? T H E L I T T L E B O O K T H AT B E ATS T H E M A R K E T [59] Good questions, certainly. Before what we learned from last chapter gets us into too much trouble, let’s see if we can find some good answers. First up, where did all those numbers come from? There’s often a problem when looking back a
