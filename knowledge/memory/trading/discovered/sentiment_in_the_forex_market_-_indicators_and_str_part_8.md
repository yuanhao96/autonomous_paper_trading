An area that has failed to receive the same amount of attention is often considered part of the technical approach: sentiment. After the news releases are digested by floor traders, the fundamentals digested by economists, and the latest comments from the central banker are dissected, the market’s trend is still a product of underlying sentiment. That is the premise of this book. Much (if not most) of the information fed to retail traders is of little use when it comes to making money by trading. Trading is hardly as simple as buying or selling, because an economic indicator is good or bad. Similarly, the game is not as black or white as buying or selling, because price is above or below a moving average. For one, I hope to prove that traditional approaches such as the economic indicator approach do not work. No consistent correlation exists between the U.S. dollar and U.S. economic indicators, but conventional wisdom says that the two move in lockstep. Why is this approach followed so fervently if its foundation is rooted in falsities? The reason that markets move in identifiable patterns is probably the same reason that many accept as gospel the conventional approaches to market analysis and trading that have marginally successful track records at best. That reason is the propensity for humans to follow the crowd, especially in situations as emotionally driven as trading. Although there are no doubt very successful news traders, the cost to the trader is significant: an expensive machine such as Bloomberg or Reuters, turbulent market conditions just after a news release, and most important—the emotional impulses that are our worst enemy in trading are heightened, and the ability to make a rational decision just after a news release is greatly reduced. I think that I can share with you a better (and cheaper) approach to analyzing and trading the FX market, an approach that will give you an edge, if only because you are not following the crowd. Sentiment indicators such as the Commitments of Traders reports are followed by many market participants, but I have developed indicators A ix P1: a/b fm P2: c/d QC: e/f JWBK195-Saettele x T1: g June 3, 2008 16:35 Printer: Yet to come PREFACE with the data that are meant to pinpoint the few times each year that a market is likely to reverse. This helps to solve one of the biggest obstacles that many face: over-trading. By limiting yourself to making a decision when a specific set of circumstances are met, you are helping to solve the over-trading problem. Unconventional sentiment indicators such as news headlines and magazine covers offer some of the best trading signals every year. Not to be forgotten are more traditional technical tools such as RSI and slow stochastics. Is the conventional use, to indicate overbought and oversold levels, really the best way to go? I think that there is a better way. What you will not find in this book are trade setups with rigid rules or money management tips. Markets are dynamic and the trader should be also. Money management will be different for everyone because everyone has an entirely different risk tolerance. What I hope that this book provides is a way for you to look at a specific market (and maybe others) for what it truly is: a collection of its participants that create a mind of its own, whose moves are endogenous in nature but, because of that very reason, can be exploited for profit.

Although Boris and I disagree on almost everything market related, he has helped me realize that more perspectives lead to a better perspective.
