PART 1 P The Most Important Factor in Your Success: YOU! long run,you’ll make big money. Did that particular pitch sound interesting to you? Well, it has attracted thousands of speculators and investors alike. And while there’s some truth to the pitch-it can be a basis for making big money in the market-it’s certainly not a magic secret to success. Many people could go broke following that advice, because it’s only part of a sound methodology For example, it does not tell you: How do you protect your capital if the market goes against you? . How or when do you take your profits? . How much do you buy or sell when you get a signal? . Which market is the method designed for or does it work in all markets? l Most importantly, you must ask yourself, when you put all those pieces together, does the method fit you? Is it something you’d be able to trade? Does it fit your investment objectives? Does it fit your personality? This book is intended to help traders and investors make more money by learning more about-themselves and then designing a methodology to fit their own personality and objectives, It is intended for both traders and investors, because both of them attempt to make money in the markets. The trader tends to have a more neutral approach-being willing to both buy and sell short. The investor, in contrast, is looking for an investment that can be purchased and held over a longer period of time. Both of them are looking for a magic system to guide their decision making-the socalled Holy Grail system. The journey into finding the profits available in the markets usually starts another way. In fact, the typical investor or trader, in preparing to trade, goes through an evolutionary process. At first he gets hooked on the idea of making a lot of money. Perhaps some broker gives him a pitch about how much money he can make playing the market. Here’s one I’ve heard in a radio advertisement in North Carolina that goes something like this: Do you know where real money is made year after year? It’s all in the agricultural sector-people have to eat. And when you consider the weather we’ve been having lately, there’s likely to be a shortage.
