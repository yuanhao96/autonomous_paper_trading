CHAPTER 1 5. 6. SO YOU WANT TO TRADE FOREX? 7 may ask, “What am I listening to?” You are listening to the market’s story. As the market moves, it “tells” a story. Because history repeats itself, where the market has been begins to predict where it is going. If you interrupt its story and try to second guess what it is going to say, you will set yourself up to make a poor decision. Although trading charts are unable to express themselves verbally, they do communicate to traders who are good listeners. You cannot find success in trading by disrupting the flow of the market’s conversation. Listen, don’t interrupt. Do you think before you speak or speak before you think? Have you ever wished you could take back something you just said? Your comments and words are like ringing a bell; once the bell is rung, you cannot “un-ring” it! Your words are like the sound of the bell—they resonate! People who speak before they think are often branded as ignorant and annoying; few are respected. On the other hand, we respect and look up to people who think before they speak; we value their conversation and opinions because they are carefully considered. Which do you do? Are you habitually putting your foot in your mouth? Or do you respond with educated answers and arguments? As a trader, you must engage in a conversation with the market and your response can either be ignorant or intelligent. If you are disciplined enough to think before you speak, you will probably find success in trading. However, if you insist on speaking before you think, the market will allow you to prove your ignorance. Do you think before you act or act before you think? The conscious and subconscious parts of your mind are your greatest assets and your greatest liabilities. The conscious mind dissects, considers, and categorizes everything you see and hear. If action is needed, the conscious mind thinks through how it will execute the action. If action is taken, the subconscious mind records the thought with the action and matches the two for future reference. In the future, all we have to do is think that thought, and the subconscious mind stands by to automatically execute the exact action that matched the thought. That is how a habit is formed. Think about it once, do it once, and you have started a habit. Think about it three times, do it three times, and you now have established an automatic habit—good or bad. When you create good 8 THE 10 ESSENTIALS OF FOREX TRADING or bad actions, your subconscious mind takes over automatically, enabling you to do things without thinking. That is both good news and bad news. If you are involved in any unproductive actions that have turned into bad habits, you are unconsciously incompetent. That is when your mind is working on destructive autopilot and you need to regain control. You need to become conscious again in order to recognize your bad habits and admit they are not benefiting you. When you recognize your bad habits, you are able to learn a new skill or a new habit to replace the unproductive one. Learning a new, productive skill or habit is the first step to managing your success. When you learn a new skill, you usually have to think through each step of the action. Thinking through that action and successfully executing it is called conscious competence. When you are disciplined enough to consciously repeat it when the situation requires, your subconscious mind automatically replaces the previously recorded action associated with the thought and forms a new habit. The subconscious mind does not think, it just recalls and executes the actions that matched the thought. The more you repeat the action—good or bad—the more that habit becomes unconsciously automatic. If you are locked into executing bad habits, you are unconsciously incompetent. If you are locked into executing good habits, you are called unconsciously competent. The road to success involves the recognition of unconscious incompetence, then passing through to conscious incompetence, working your way to conscious competence, and eventually arriving at unconscious competence. In achieving this you have purged yourself of your bad habits and have replaced them with productive, automatic, good habits that allow you to perform successful actions without thinking about them. It is like learning to drive a car. Think back: the first time you got into the driver’s seat, you literally had to think through everything that needed to be done just to pull out of the driveway. That process took about 15 minutes because you had to consciously think through everything you did. You were consciously competent. Now, if you began to drive and received speeding tickets and got into accidents, you became unconsciously incompetent. It was when you consciously committed yourself to stop speeding and to look in every direction to avoid accidents that you became a consciously competent driver. Today, if you have been driving and are free from speeding tickets
