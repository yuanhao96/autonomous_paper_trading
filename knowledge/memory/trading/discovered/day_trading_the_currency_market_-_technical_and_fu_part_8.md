Chapter 7. 96 Figure 8.22 USD/CAD Channel Example (Source: eSignal. www.eSignal.com) The next example, shown in Figure 8.23 is a 30-minute chart of EUR/GBP. The total range between the two lines is 15 pips. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 0.6796 and 0.6763. The order to go long gets triggered first and almost immediately we place a stop order 10 pips under the upper… ************************************* PAGE 126 ************************************* Figure 8.24 EUR/USD Channel Example (Source: eSignal. www.eSignal.com) 97 PERFECT ORDER …price level than the 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day SMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below the 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, when the 200-day SMA is at the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving averages stacked up in sequential order is generally a strong indicator of a trending environment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of the trend, but the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the perfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and trending upward. Entry and exit levels are difficult to determine with this strategy, but we generally want to stay in the trade as long as the perfect order holds and exit once the perfect order no longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is to capture the perfect order when it first happens. The perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the beginning of the trend. Here are the rules for using this technique. 1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order. 2. Look for ADX pointing upward, ideally greater than 20. … ************************************* PAGES 128-129 ************************************* … fect order no longer holds and the 20-day SMA moves below the 10-day SMA. This occurs on December 16,2005, when prices open al 1.1420. The total profit on this track is 410 pips. We risked 97 pips. Figure 8.27 is a perfect order formation in the USD/CAD. The formation materialized on September 30, 2004. We count five bars forward and enter into the position at 1.2588 with a stop at 1.2588. The pair then proceeds to sell off and we look to exit the position when the perfect order formation no longer holds. This occurs on December 9, 2005, at which time we buy back our position at 1.2115 for a 443-pip profit while risking 149 pips. 98 Fundamental Trading Strategies ************************************* PAGE 131 ************************************* Picking the Strongest Pairing … because at the time, Britain's economy had been exhibiting a consistent, impressive amount of economic growth, which, after the compulsive dollar frenzy, helped it gain hack some substantial ground within a matter of a few weeks. The rebound in the British pound against the dollar can be seen in Figure 9.1. After hitting a low of 1.8595 on March 28, the pair proceeded to rebound back toward its pre-FOMC level of 1.9200 over the next three weeks. Figure 9.1 GBP/USD Post Fed Meeting (Source: eSignal. www.eSignal.com) On the other hand, the Japanese yen saw a depreciation over a much longer period of time with a continual upward movement in the USD/JPY pair well into the middle of April. This price action can be seen in Figure 9.2. After the FOMC meeting, the dollar proceeded to strengthen another 300 pips over the next two weeks. Part of the reason for the differences in these movements was that market watchers did not have much faith in the Japanese economy, which had been teetering on the edge of recession and showing no signs of positive economic expansion. Therefore, the dollar strength had a much higher impact and an increased amount of staying power with the struggling yen than with the consistently strong pound. ************************************* PAGE 133 ************************************* 99 Figure 9.3 AUD/JPY Post Fed Meeting (Source: eSignal. www.eSignal.com) Figure 9.4 EUR/JPY Post Fed Meeting (Source: eSignal. www.eSignal.com) LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE THE leveraged carry trade strategy is one of the favorite trading strategies of global macro hedge funds and investment banks. It is the quintessential global macro trade. In a nutshell, the carry trade strategy entails going long or buying a high100 yielding currency and selling or shorting a low-yielding currency. Aggressive speculators will leave the exchange rate exposure unhedged, which means that the speculator is betting that the high-yielding currency is going to appreciate in addition to earning the interest rate differential between the two currencies. For those who hedge the exchange rate exposure, although interest rate differentials tend to be rather small, on the scale of 1 to 5 percent, if traders factor in 5 to 10 times leverage, the profits from interest rates alone can be substantial. Just think about it: A 2.5 percent interest rate differential becomes 25 percent on 10 times leverage. Leverage can also be very risky if not managed properly because it can exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation generally occurs when a number of traders see this same opportunity and also pile info the trade, which ends up rallying the currency pair. In foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is an easy way to take advantage of this basic economic principle that money is constantly flowing in and out of different markets, driven by the economic law of supply and demand: markets that offer the highest returns on investment will in general attract the most capital. Countries are no different in the world of international capital flows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract the most investment and create the most demand for their currencies. A very popular trading strategy, the carry trade is
