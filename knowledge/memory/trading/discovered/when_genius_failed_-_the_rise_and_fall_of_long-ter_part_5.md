The partners were nervous but agreed to take over Eckstein's position.For the next couple of weeks,the spread continued to widen, and Salomon suffered a serious loss. The firm's capital account used to be scribbled in a little book, left outside the office of a partner named Allan Fine, and each afternoon the partners would nervously tiptoe over to Fine's to see how much they had lost. Meriwethercoolly insisted that they would come out ahead. \"We better,\" John Gutfreund, the managing partner, told him, \"or you'll be fired.\" The prices did converge, and Salomon made a bundle.Hardly anyone traded financial futures then, but Meriwether und'erstood them.
