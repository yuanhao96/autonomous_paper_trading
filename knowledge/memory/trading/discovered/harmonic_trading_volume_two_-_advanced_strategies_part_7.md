Chapter 1 Contemporary Market Case Studies from a Harmonic Trading Perspective Since the inception of my website, HarmonicTrader.com, I have released a variety of reports that have assessed critical long-term turning points in the markets. Specifically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), and the NASDAQ Composite Index have experienced a wide variety of market extremes in the past two decades. Despite such extreme volatile long-term price action, Harmonic Trading effectively and accurately provided reliable analysis of the most critical turning points and outlined precise possibilities of probable future action that these markets were facing. In fact, the challenging environment of the past two decades has proven to be a comprehensive test for Harmonic Trading techniques. For example, the Dow Jones Industrials and the S&P 500 have both experienced multi-year bull and bear markets since 2000. This era compares on par with some of the most volatile market environments in history. Notwithstanding, these markets pale in comparison to the incredulous tech bubble in NASDAQ Composite Index at the turn of the century. This index rallied several hundred percent at the end of the 1990s only to lose 80% of those gains in less than three years. These long-term situations challenged the measurement strategies of this approach to decipher the most critical levels of support and resistance and to determine the overall future direction of the markets. The ability of the Harmonic Trading methodology to define the critical long-term market turning points has tremendously validated this approach. For example, the bear market of 2008-2009 possessed a substantial weekly 5-0 pattern that defined the clear make-or-break support zone for the index. Although I no longer operated an advisory service, I posted an initial report of the long-term possibilities outlining the situation earlier in 2008 before the dramatic decline. Since the market environment has changed drastically from the 1990s, it is important to review some historical developments that were a crucial element in the evolution of this approach. Harmonic Trading was conceived during a particularly bullish era for the markets. Stocks were traded mostly, as currencies and commodities experienced far less public participation than today. Despite the entrenched bullish trend of the 1990s, the market manifested evidence of trouble soon after the decade ended. Although the “pre-9/11” market climate seems as if it is ancient history, these events hold tremendous significance for today and the future. The technical significance of the price action in these markets impacts long-term structural considerations and serves as the established price limits for Harmonic Trading measurements going forward. 11 12 Harmonic Trading: Volume Two The following analysis of these major U.S. indices has two purposes. First, the review of such historic action underscores the importance of these techniques to be analyzed in long-term cases with the same considerations as intra-day situations. The primary difference is that instead of minutes to react as is the case for intra-day opportunities, these markets involved days and weeks of analysis to accurately assess their validity. Second, these markets distinguished the Harmonic Trading approach more than any other situation. At each turn, the reports posted on the website and in related Internet articles accurately outlined the reason for the change in trend based upon distinct harmonic pattern completions and other technical considerations. The bear market of 2000 and subsequent low in 2003 impacted this approach immensely. The importance of pattern failures during this time was one of the discoveries that expanded the scope of Harmonic Trading. The price action of 2008 reinforced this principle further and engendered an even more vigilant monitoring of the markets in general. Unlike the decisive bullish trend of prior decades, the long-term structure of these indices has vast implications for the future direction and influence on other markets, such as commodities and currencies. The following case studies review these historic patterns and illustrate the clear signals outlined by the Harmonic Trading approach that defined each situation. Starting with actual market reports from my original advisory service from the early 2000s, this review represents a live assessment of the action as it happened. Furthermore, my ability to predict the bear decline of 2008 was directly influenced by the lessons learned from those early days. The Bear Market of 2000—Same Patterns, Different Day The true challenge of these changing market environments required a thorough assessment of weekly and monthly harmonic price levels to offer relevant information—let alone pinpoint exact lows and highs of multiyear trends. It is important to remember that Harmonic Trading concepts were relatively new in 2000. The strategies were yielding tremendous success in short-term situations, but the question that loomed in my mind as I refined the approach was whether weekly, monthly, and even yearly Harmonic Trading measurements would be as reliable. The other dilemma that preceded the turn of the century was the predominant bullish bias of the 1980s and 1990s. The incredible advancement of the Internet in particular opened financial markets to a generation of new online traders. This bullish fervor was the backdrop for unrealistic aspirations and distorted long-term realities. As the bull market of the late 1990s waned, many were locked into a one-sided bias and were unable to adapt to the impending changes. Although bullish harmonic patterns were accurately defining significant opportunities in those early years, the powerful bear market of 2000 overwhelmed many substantial setups. The failure of daily and weekly bullish patterns forced me to step back and take a hard look at the flexibility of this methodology. It beca
