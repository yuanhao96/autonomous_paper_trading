PART V Multiple-Market Players 107 108 Tom Basso: Mr. Serenity To be frank, Tom Basso was not on my list of interview subjects for this book. Although his track record is solid, it is by no means striking. As a stock account manager, he has averaged 16 percent annually since 1980, approximately 5 percent above the S&P 500 return. Quite respectable, considering that the majority of managers underper-form the index, but still not the stuff of legends. As a futures fund manager, Basso has averaged 20 percent annually since 1987 with only moderate volatility. Here, too, the results are significantly better than the industry average, but hardly extraordinary. And yet, in an important sense, Basso is perhaps the most successful trader I have interviewed. To paraphrase a recent commercial, how do you spell success? If your answer is M-O-S-T B-U-C-K-S, then Basso doesn't make the grade. If, however, your answer is G-OO-D B-U-C-K-S, G-R-E-A-T L-I-F-E, then Basso has few peers. When I first met Basso, I was immediately struck by his incredible ease about trading. He has learned to accept losses in trading not only in an intellectual sense but on an emotional level as well. Moreover, his feelings of exuberance about trading (or, for that matter, about life) bubble right out of him. Basso has managed to be a profitable trader while apparently maintaining complete peace of mind and experiencing great joy. In this sense, I can't think of a more worthy role model for a trader. I knew within minutes of meeting Basso that he was someone I wanted to include in this book. I also realized that my method of selecting interview subjects strictly on the basis of numbers was a somewhat myopic approach. Basso started out as an engineer for Monsanto Company. He found that this job didn't fully absorb his energies, and he began dabbling in the investment field. His first foray into the financial markets was a commodity (futures) account, which proved to be an immediate disaster. Although it took many years before Basso was able to trade futures profitably, he persisted until he finally succeeded. In 1980, he began managing equity accounts as an outgrowth of an involvement in an investment club. In 1984 he expanded his management scope to include futures accounts as well. The small size of most of these futures accounts (many as small as $25,000) resulted in excessive volatility. Basso realized that in order to reduce volatility to a reasonable level while still maintaining adequate diversification, he would have to drastically raise his minimum account size. In 1987, he raised his minimum to $1 million and returned the funds of all clients with smaller accounts. Today, he continues to manage both stock and futures accounts. Basso and I met at a psychology investment seminar mn by Dr. Van Tharp and Adrienne Toghiaie. The seminar was held in the somewhat unlikely locale of Newark, New Jersey. The interview was conducted over lunch at a local diner. ==== One of the things that immediately struck me about you is that you have this aura of incredible relaxation-almost bliss-about your trading. It's the antithesis of the mental state people typically associate with traders. Have you always had this attitude about trading? ==== Not at all. I still remember my first trade. In 1975,1 opened a commodity account for $2,000. I bought two corn contracts and immediately lost $600. My stomach was turning. I couldn't concentrate on my work. (I was an engineer in those days.) I called my broker every hour. ==== Do you remember your motivation for that trade? ==== I put on the trade because of a rather naive study I did in which I found that a certain very infrequent chart pattern had been followed by a price advance 100 percent of the time. Several years ago I heard you give a speech in which you talked about "the well-chosen example." 1 laughed to myself when I heard you use that phrase because it reminded me of my first trade, which was the epitome of the well-chosen example. [The well-chosen example Basso is referring to represents one of my pet peeves. The basic contention is that virtually any system ever invented can be made to look great if one simply illustrates the approach by selecting the historical market that proved most favorable for the particular method. I first became aware of this concept in the mid-1980s, when I read an article on a simple, fully disclosed trading system. At that time I was working on a rather complex system of my own. To my shock and dismay, this very simple system seemed to have outperformed the far more complicated system I had spent so much time developing-at least for the one illustration provided. 1 reread the article with greater scmtiny. The proposed system consisted of only two conditions. I and Norman Strahm, my partner in system development at the time who did all our programming, had tested one of the conditions before. We knew it to be a net winning, albeit only moderately performing, trading rule. The other condition was a rule that we considered to have such a poor prospect of success that we never even bothered testing it. However, if the system described in the article were really that good, its superiority had to come from including this second condition-a trading rule we had dismissed out of hand. Naturally, we tested this second condition. Its performance for the market illustrated in the article was exactly as indicated. However, the time period selected for the example just happened to be the single best year in a ten-year test period for that market. In fact, it was the single best year for any of the twenty-five markets we tested for that ten-year period. No wonder the system had appeared to be that good-we were looking at the single best case out of the 250 possible market and year combinations we tested. What a coincidence! I'm sure hindsight had nothing to do with it. But that's not the end of the story. The system did dismally in the remainder of the test sample. In f
