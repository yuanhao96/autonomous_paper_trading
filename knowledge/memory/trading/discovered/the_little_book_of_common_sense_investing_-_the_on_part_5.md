Chapter 1. Investors pay far too little attention to the costs of investing. It’s especially easy to underrate their importance under today’s three conditions: (1) when so many costs are hidden from view (portfolio transaction costs, the unrecognized impact of front-end sales changes, taxes incurred on realized gains); (2) when stock market returns have been high (during the 1980s and 1990s, stock returns averaged 17.5 percent per year, and the average fund provided a nontrivial—but clearly inadequate—return of 15 percent); and especially (3) when investors focus on short-term returns, ignoring the truly confiscatory impact of cost over an investment lifetime. Perhaps an example will help. Let’s assume the stock market generates a total return averaging 8 percent per year over a half century. Yes, that’s a long time, but an investment lifetime is now actually even longer—65 or 70 years for an investor who goes to work at age 22, begins T U R N I N G A W I N N E R ’ S G A M E I N TO A L O S E R ’ S G A M E [41] to invest immediately, and works until, say, age 65; and then continues to invest over an actuarial expectancy of 20 or more years thereafter. Now let’s assume that the costs of the average mutual fund continue at their present rate of at least 2.5 percent per year. Result: a net annual return of just 5.5 percent for the average fund.  $10,000 grows to $469,000 . . . or $145,400. Where did that $323,600 go? Based on these assumptions, let’s look at the returns earned on $10,000 over 50 years (Exhibit 4.1). The simple investment in the stock market grows to $469,000, a remarkable illustration of the magic of compounding returns over an investment lifetime. In the early years, the line showing the growth at a 5.5 percent annual rate doesn’t look all that different from the growth in the stock market itself. But ever so slowly, the lines begin to diverge, finally at a truly dramatic rate. By the end of the long period, the value accumulated in the fund totals just $145,400, an astounding shortfall of $323,600 to the cumulative return earned in the market itself. In the investment field, time doesn’t heal all wounds. It makes them worse. Where returns are concerned, time is your friend. But where costs are concerned, time [42] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING Exhibit 4.1 The Magic of Compounding Returns, the Tyranny of Compounding Costs: Growth of $10,000 over 50 Years 500 Thousands ($) 400 469,000 8.0% before costs 5.5% after costs 300 200 145,400 100,600 100 21,600 49,800 0 17,100 10 20 Years 30 40 50 is your enemy. This point is powerfully illustrated when we consider how much of the value of the $10,000 investment is eroded with each passing year (Exhibit 4.2). By the end of the first year, only about 2 percent of the value of your capital has vanished ($10,800 vs. $10,550). By the 10th year, 21 percent has vanished ($21,600 vs. $17,100). By the 30th year, 50 percent has vanished ($100,600 vs. $49,800). And by the end of the investment period, costs have consumed nearly 70 percent of the potential accumulation available simply by holding the market portfolio.

The system of financial intermediation, which put up zero percent of the capital and assumed zero percent of the risk, essentially confiscated 70 percent of that return—surely the lion’s share. What you see here—and please don’t ever forget it!—is that over the long term, the miracle of compounding returns is overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs. Add that mathematical certainty to the relentless rules of humble arithmetic described earlier. [44] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING  The miracle of compounding returns is overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs. But enough of theory and hypothetical examples. Let’s see how this principle works in the real world. During the quarter century from 1980 to 2005, the return on the stock market (measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index) averaged 12.5 percent per year. The return on the average mutual fund averaged just 10.0 percent. That 2.5 percent differential is about what one might have expected, given our earlier 3 percent rough estimate of fund costs. (Never forget: Market return, minus cost, equals investor return.) Simply put, our fund managers, sitting at the top of the investment food chain, have confiscated an excessive share of the financial markets’ returns. Fund investors, inevitably at the bottom of the food chain, have been left with too small a share. Investors need not have incurred that loss. For they could have easily invested in a simple index fund tracking the S&P 500. Such a fund actually returned 12.3 percent per year during that period—the market return of 12.5 percent less costs of just 0.2 percent. That is an annual margin of superiority of 2.3 percent over the average fund. On first impression, that annual gap may not look large. But when compounded over 25 years, it reaches staggering proportions. A $10,000 initial investment in the T U R N I N G A W I N N E R ’ S G A M E I N TO A L O S E R ’ S G A M E [45] index fund grew by a remarkable $170,800, compared with growth of just $98,200 in the average equity mutual fund— only 57 percent of the total accumulation in the index fund. But let’s face the facts. Both of these accumulations are overstated because they are based on 2005 dollars, which have less than half the spending power they enjoyed in 1980. During this period, inflation eroded the real buying power of these returns at an average rate of 3.3 percent per year. When we turn those nominal dollars—the dollars that we
