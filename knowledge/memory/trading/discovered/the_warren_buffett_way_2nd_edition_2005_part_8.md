Chapter 8.) A franchise that is the only source of a product people want can regularly increase prices without fear of losing market share or unit volume. Often a franchise can raise its prices even when demand is f lat and capacity is not fully utilized. This pricing f lexibility is one of the defining characteristics of a franchise; it allows franchises to earn aboveaverage returns on invested capital. Look for the durability of the franchise. The most important thing to me is figuring out how big a moat there is around the business. What I love, of course, is a big castle and a big moat with piranhas and crocodiles.15 WARREN BUFFETT, 1994 Another defining characteristic is that franchises possess a greater amount of economic goodwill, which enables them to better withstand the effects of inf lation. Another is the ability to survive economic mishaps and still endure. In Buffett’s succinct phrase, “The definition of a great company is one that will be great for 25 to 30 years.”16 Conversely, a commodity business offers a product that is virtually indistinguishable from the products of its competitors. Years ago, basic commodities included oil, gas, chemicals, wheat, copper, lumber, and orange juice. Today, computers, automobiles, airline service, banking, and insurance have become commodity-type products. Despite mammoth advertising budgets, they are unable to achieve meaningful product differentiation. Commodity businesses, generally, are low-returning businesses and “prime candidates for profit trouble.”17 Since their product is basically no different from anyone else’s, they can compete only on the basis of price, which severely undercuts profit margins. The most dependable ( Text continues on page 77.) CASE IN POINT JUSTIN INDUSTRIES, 2000 In July 2000, Berkshire Hathaway bought 100 percent of Texasbased Justin Industries for $600 million. The company has two divisions: Justin Brands, which comprises four brands of Western boots, and Acme Building Brands, with companies that make bricks and other building products. Cowboy boots and bricks. It is one of Berkshire’s most interesting, and most colorful, acquisitions. And it says a great deal about Warren Buffett. In many ways, Justin epitomizes all the business strengths that Buffett looks for. Clearly, it is simple and understandable; there’s nothing particularly complex about boots or bricks. It represents a remarkably consistent operating history, as a look at the separate companies will show; all have been at the same business for many decades, and most are at least a century old. Finally, and most especially, Buffett recognized favorable longterm prospects, because of one aspect that he highly admires: in what are essentially commodity industries, the products have achieved franchise status. Justin Brands The company that is now Justin began in 1879 when H. J. ( Joe) Justin, who was then 20 years old, started making boots for cowboys and ranchers from his small shop in Spanish Fort, Texas, near the Chisholm Trail. When Joe died in 1918, his sons John and Earl took over and in 1925 moved the company to Fort Worth. In 1948, Joe’s grandson John Jr. bought out his relatives (except Aunt Enid), and guided the business for the next fifty years. John Justin Jr. was a legendary figure in Fort Worth. He built an empire of Western boots by acquiring three rival companies, worked out the deal to buy Acme Bricks in 1968, and served a term as Fort Worth mayor. He retired in 1999, but stayed on as chairman emeritus, and that’s why, at the age of 83, it was he who welcomed Warren Buffett to town in April 2000. 72 Justin Boots, known for rugged, long-lasting boots for working cowboys, remains the f lagship brand. But Justin Brands includes other names. • Nocona, founded in 1925 by Enid Justin. One of Joe Justin’s seven children, Enid started working in her father’s company when she was twelve. After her nephews moved the family business from the small town of Nocona, Texas, to Fort Worth in 1925, Enid set up a rival company in the original locale. Against all odds, she built a success. Fierce competitors for years, the two companies were joined under the Justin name in 1981. Enid, who was then 85, reluctantly agreed to the merger because of her declining health. • Chippewa, founded in 1901 as a maker of boots for loggers, today makes sturdy hiking boots and quality outdoor work boots. It was acquired by Justin in 1985. • Tony Lama, which dates back to 1911, when Tony Lama, who had been a cobbler in the U.S. Army, opened a shoerepair and boot-making shop in El Paso. The boots quickly became a favorite of local ranchers and cowboys who valued the good fit and long-lasting quality. In recent years, for many the Tony Lama name has become synonymous with high-end boots handcrafted from exotic leathers such as boa, alligator, turtle, and ostrich, many with prices near $500. In 1990, Tony Lama Jr., chairman and CEO, agreed to merge with archrival Justin. Two groups of people buy Western-style boots: those who wear them day in and day out, because they can’t imagine wearing anything else; and those who wear them as fashion. The first group is the heart of Justin’s customer base, but the second group, while smaller, does have an impact on sales volume as fashion trends twist and turn. When big-name designers like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein show Western styles in their catalogs, boot sales climb. But fashion is notoriously fickle, and the company struggled in the late 1990s. After a peak in 1994, the sales of Western boots began to decline. In 1999, Justin’s stock price dipped below $13. (Continued) 73 John Justin Jr. retired in April 1999, and John Roach, former head of the Tandy Corp., came in to lead a restructuring. In just over a year, the new management engineered an impressive turnaround—adding new footwear products, consolidating the existing lines to eliminate duplicate designs, and instituting efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution.
