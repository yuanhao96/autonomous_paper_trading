Kirkpatrick, my father, and ex-portfolio manager for Fidelity beginning in the 1950s. He introduced me to technical analysisthe age of 14 by asking me to update his charts. In the year of his retirement, 1968, he managed the best-performing mutual fund in the world. To the Market Technicians Association, through which I have met many of the best innovators and practitioners of technical analysis, and especially to staff members Cassandra Townes and Marie Penza for their support and assistance in making available the MTA library. To Skip Cave, past dean of the Fort Lewis College School of Business Administration, for allowing me to assist him in teaching a course in technical analysis, for getting this project going by introducing me to other textbook authors, such as the Assistant Dean Roy Cook, and for providing office space during the initial writing and researching for this book. To Thomas Harrington, past dean of the Fort Lewis College School of Business Administration, for allowing me to maintain an office at the college, for allowing me special privileges at the college library, and for asking me to continue teaching a course in technical analysis. To my students in class BA317 at Fort Lewis College School of Business Administration, for being my teaching guinea pigs and for keeping me on my toes with questions and observations. To my friends and colleagues at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, specifically Vinnie Casella, past president, who taught me from the inside how markets really work. To the dedicated people at Pearson Education, specifically Jim Boyd, executive editor; Pamela Boland, editorial assistant; Betsy Harris, production editor; Karen Annett, copy editor; and all the others behind the scenes who I have not known directly. To Phil Roth and Bruce Kamich, both past presidents of the Market Technicians Association, professional technical analysts, and adjunct professors teaching courses in technical analysis at universities in the New York area, for editing the material in this book and keeping me in line. To Julie Dahlquist, my coauthor, and her husband, Richard Bauer, both professors steeped in the ways of academia, for bringing that perspective to this book. To my wife, Ellie, who has had to put up with me for 48 years and has always done so pleasantly and with love.

And to my grandchildren, India and Mila, who didn’t do anything for the book but who pleaded to be mentioned. I thank you and all the many others from my lifetime of work in technical analysis for your support, friendship, and willingness to impart your knowledge of trading markets. Charles Kirkpatrick Kittery, Maine The assistance and support of many people contributed to turning the dream of this book into a reality. Fred Meissner was the one who initially introduced me to my coauthor, Charlie, at a Market Technicians Association chapter meeting. After I worked with Charlie on several projects and we served together on the Market Technicians Association Educational Foundation Board, he bravely agreed to a partnership in writing this book. Charlie has been the ideal coauthor—positive, patient, and persistent. It has been an honor to work with someone so knowledgeable and an incredible experience to work with someone so willing to share his knowledge. The faculty and staff in the Department of Finance at the University of Texas at San Antonio College of Business have been a pleasure to work with over the past couple of years while this book has been in process. Keith Fairchild, Lula Misra, and Robert Lengel have been especially supportive. The expertise of the dedicated team at Pearson Education has been invaluable in helping Charlie and me get our ideas into this final format. Thanks to Jim Boyd, Pamela Boland, Betsy Harris, Karen Annett, and the entire Pearson Education team for their gentle prodding, their continued encouragement, and their tireless commitment to this project. My husband, Richard Bauer, assisted in more ways than can ever be counted. He graciously wrote the Basic Statistics appendix for this book. He served as a sounding board for ma
