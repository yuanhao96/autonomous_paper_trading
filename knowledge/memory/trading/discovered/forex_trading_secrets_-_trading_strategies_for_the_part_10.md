CHAPTER 2 MAJOR CURRENCIES AND PAIRS 13 Australia’s political and economic stability. The volatility it shows in the markets is low. Australia’s economy is based on domestic industrial production (particularly of machinery and transportation equipment) and export of raw materials (mostly from its huge mining activity) and products from its agricultural sector. THE CANADIAN DOLLAR The Canadian dollar (CAD) is the base or quote currency with the following FOREX major and crossed-rate currency pairs: USD/CAD, CAD/JPY, CAD/CHF, AUD/CAD, EUR/CAD, GBP/CAD, and NZD/CAD. The CAD is the official currency of Canada. Coin and bill denominations are similar to those of the U.S. dollar. It is familiarly called the “loonie” because of the image of a loon that appears on one of the faces of the coins, and traders also use this nickname to designate the USD/CAD currency pair. The volatility of the Canadian dollar in the FOREX market is low, although it is heavily related to fluctuations in oil prices. The economy of Canada is quite similar to that of the United States, being market- and production-oriented, having evolved from a mostly rural economy (before World War II), and now being principally urban and industrial, with the increase in manufacturing, mining, and service sectors. Its principal trading partner is the United States. THE BRITISH POUND The British pound sterling (GBP) is the base or quote currency with the following FOREX major and crossed-rate currency pairs: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP, GBP/CHF, GBP/AUD, GBP/CAD, and GBP/NZD. Additionally, the GBP is the base currency paired with the following currencies: NOK, SEK, SGD, DKK, CNY, MXN, BRL, ZAR, and other exotic currencies depending on each broker’s availability. The GBP is the official currency used in the United Kingdom (Great Britain). It is one of the world’s most widely traded currencies, along with the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Swiss franc. Additionally, it is the currency unit with the highest value among the “majors.” The GBP/USD currency pair is familiarly called the “cable” in traders’ slang because the rates originally were transmitted via a trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. The market volatility of this currency is low to medium. 14 FOREX TRADING SECRETS The economy of the United Kingdom is one of the largest in the world, with a strong agriculture and mining industry. The services sector represents the main percentage of the gross domestic product, and tourism has been developing strongly in recent years. THE SWISS FRANC The Swiss franc (CHF) is the base or quote currency with the following FOREX major and crossed-rate currency pairs: USD/CHF, CHF/JPY, GBP/CHF, EUR/CHF, CAD/CHF, AUD/CHF, and NZD/CHF. The CHF is the official currency of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The currency is used by the Central Bank of Switzerland. The letters CHF stand for “Confederatio Helvetica Franc.” The USD/CHF currency pair is familiarly referred to as the “Swissie” among FOREX traders. The volatility of the Swiss franc in the FOREX market is usually low to moderate. The CHF is a fairly stable currency, especially in its relationship to the euro, with which it maintains a strong correlation. This causes the EUR/USD and USD/CHF currency pairs to be the highest negatively correlated pairs, with a factor of more than 90 percent. Thanks to Switzerland’s strong political and economic stability, the currency is used mostly as a reserve currency by financial institutions and wealthy private individuals throughout the world. THE JAPANESE YEN The Japanese yen (JPY) is the base or quote currency with the following FOREX major and crossed-rate currency pairs: USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, CHF/JPY, CAD/JPY, AUD/JPY, and NZD/JPY. The JPY is the official national currency of Japan. Originally pegged to the USD after World War II, the yen switched to a system of floating exchange rates after 1971. The volatility of the JPY in the FOREX market is usually low to medium. Japan’s economy is predominantly based on its manufacturing industry. The JPY traditionally has been a weak currency because its circulation is limited to domestic business, thus hindering Japan’s position with regard to foreign trade. Additionally, the country depends completely on oil imports and exclusively on its export of manufactured goods; this renders the JPY very sensitive to rises in crude oil prices and overall energy costs.
