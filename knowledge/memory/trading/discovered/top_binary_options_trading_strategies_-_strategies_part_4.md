same happens with the pinnochio strategy - when the wick is longer than the body, this tells us that the market is deceiving us and that we should trade the opposite way! The entry point varies, as some traders prefer to wait for the next candle to retrace to the 50% Fibonacci level of the Pin bar, while others enter immediately after the Pin bar closes. A long wick indicates strong selling pressure, whereas a long tail suggests intense buying power. Key elements • Time-frame for analysis: 1h, 4h • Expiry time to use: 5-15 min win % 68 rate Watch out • Do not use 60 second expiry time! • Do not trade in a neutral market! A true bearish pinocchio signal must come after an uptrend (see image above). Trying to trade the bearish Pinocchio pattern in neutral market conditions can be risky. #3 Strategies The 1-2-3 Strategy 1. If a peak is not surpassed, it becomes point 1. 3. Point 3 does not go higher than point 1. PUT 2. Point 2 marks the end of a counter move. Description 1. After an uptrend or at least a strong move up, look for the 1 – 2 – 3 pattern to form, starting of course with the first peak (1). 2. Now, if a counter move starts, mark the bottom of that move with (2). 3. If the new move up does not surpass point 1 and starts turning down, mark the highest point of this new move up with (3). 4. our pattern is now complete. However, there is still a very important rule that must be observed: the price must move down to break the low created at point (2). If that happens, all our conditions are met, and we enter the trade with a ‘Put’. Key elements • Choose expiry time equal to the time frame in which you spot the pattern. Watch out • It is better to open two trades with smaller expiry times than 1 trade with longer expiry times. #4 Strategies Social Binary Strategy Description Social trading features enable you to view other traders' positions on your chart, witness others' investment decisions and tap into collective wisdom. Social trading is still new for binary options and is not yet as advanced as with forex copy trading, where you can follow and copy your favorite traders, analyze their past performance and ask them questions. Neverthe less, social trading is a good way for beginners to get a feel for the binary options market, confirm their ideas and strategies or look for advice. Brokers with social feature • Ubinary Social - Binary options (not available in US) • 24 Bulls - Binary options (not available in the US) • Zulu Trade - Forex (available for US clients) • eToro - Forex (not available for US clients) Drawbacks of Binary Social Trading • Trader profiles with past performances not yet available. • Not possible to automatically copy trades of favorite traders.
