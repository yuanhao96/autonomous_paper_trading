asking yourself three questions: 1. Is volume still relevant today? 2. Is it relevant to the market I trade? 3. Can it be applied to all trading and investing strategies? Let me try to answer the first if I can with an extract from Stocks and Commodities magazine. The following quote was by David Penn, a staff writer at the time for the magazine, who wrote the following about Wykcoff in an article in 2002: “Many of Wyckoff’s basic tenets have become de facto standards of technical analysis: The concepts of accumulation/distribution and the supremacy of price and volume in determining stock price movement are examples.” The second question, I can only answer from a personal perspective. I began my own trading career in the futures market trading indices. From there I moved into the cash markets for investing, commodities for speculating, and finally into the currency markets in both futures and spot. In all of these, I have used volume and price as my primary analytical approach to each of these markets, even spot forex. And yes, there is volume in forex as well! Volume Price Analysis can be applied to each and every market. The approach is universal. Once learnt you will be able to apply this methodology to any time frame and to every instrument. Finally, the best way to answer the third question of whether Volume Price Analysis can be applied to all trading and investing strategies, is with a quotation from Richard Wyckoff who, as you will find out shortly, is the founding father of Volume Price Analysis. He wrote the following in his book 'Studies in Tape Reading' “In judging the market by its own actions, it is unimportant whether you are endeavouring to forecast the next small half hourly swing, or the trend for the next two or three weeks. The same indications as to price, volume, activity, support, and pressure are exhibited in the preparation for both. The same elements will be found in a drop of water as in the ocean, and vice versa” So the simple truth is this. Regardless of whether you are scalping as a speculator in stocks, bonds, currencies and equities, or you are trend, swing, or position trader in these markets, or even investing for the longer term, the techniques you will discover here are as valid today as they were almost 100 years ago. The only proviso is that we have price and volume on the same chart. For this powerful technique we have to thank the great traders of the last century, who laid the foundations of what we call technical analysis today. Iconic names such as Charles Dow, founder of the Dow Jones, Dow Theory and the Wall Street Journal, and generally referred to as the grandfather of technical analysis. One of Dow's principle beliefs was that volume confirmed trends in price. He maintained that if a price was moving on low volume, then there could be many different reasons. However, when a price move was associated with high or rising volume, then he believed this was a valid move. If the price continued moving in
