that would soon deliver, with cold indifference, a verdict of survival or—more likely—utter ruin.

The chauffeur knew the drill, he had to enter the driveway at seven twenty. Jesse Livermore was a precise man. A light gray fog wafted in from Long Island Sound. It accentuated the cold air, the change of seasons, and added an ominous feel to the air. As usual, the car rolled down the long circular drive at precisely 7:20 and stopped in front of Livermore. He nodded silently to the chauffeur, opened his own door, and slipped into the back seat, the newspapers folded under his arm. He placed them on the leather seats as he did every morning: the New York Times, the London Times, the Wall Street Journal.

His fortune would rest on the answers to these questions, and he had long ago realized that it was what people actually did in the stock market that counted—not what they said they were going to do. Some people might want to see the human chaos, feel the desperate financial pandemonium that occurred when the fear-devil rose up and conquered the greed-god that had appeared so strong and indestructible—but not Livermore; he wanted to stay untouched by these human reactions. He would be able to see everything clearly soon enough. He would listen to the quiet clicking verdict of the stock tickers in his office
