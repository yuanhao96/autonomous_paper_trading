Chapter 60 for more information. If it breaks out upward with gusto, watch for price to peak in a week or two and then start heading back down. If the stock peaks, the decline might be a massive one, so consider selling then. If you are in a raging bull market and you like the company, then hold the stock, especially if it is near the yearly low (the best performing 3S patterns start there). Eventually the stock is going to go down, just keep raising your stop until it takes you out. Short the stock. Shorting a stock is a risky play as it depends on correctly predicting the top in a stock. If you suspect price has reached its high and is now heading down, consider selling short. Use a stop to protect yourself and have good reasons based on both fundamental and technical analysis before you place the trade. With this pattern, the top usually—but not always—comes quickly. Sample Trade Look at Figure 61.5 for a sample trade. Ann Taylor announces same-store sales on a monthly basis. Thus, you have plenty of trading opportunities each year. The patterns marked on the chart are all valid 3S chart patterns. They have upward breakouts and they gap upward or show an above average trading range on the announcement day or the day after. In the April announcement, price climbs and rounds over in a week and tumbles, ending well below the close the day before the announcement. That curling action is an example of a throwback. The May announcement shows an upward price gap, price rises for another day and then it retraces in a flag pattern. After the flag, price resumes its climb in a stair-step manner. The June 3S pattern is similar to April, only wider. Price rounds over and finds support at the announcement day gap. Most of the time (91%), price will stop before reaching the bottom of the gap. The July pattern looks a lot like the April pattern, including the decline afterward. The August pattern behaves like the May pattern, with a rise-retrace climb. The September climb is a wider version of April, and so is the November pattern. 4366_61.qxd 2/23/05 12:27 PM Page 933 For Best Performance 933 On this chart, we have five patterns that behave similarly (April, June, July, September, and November) with the other two showing extended rises. These patterns suggest that you avoid buying a stock expecting a long rise after a 3S pattern. A better plan is to actively trade the 3S pattern by buying quickly, riding it upward for a few days, and then selling. Alternatively, wait for price to top out and then short the stock. Before you short a stock using the 3S pattern, use a sheet of paper to cover each figure in the chapter and slowly move it to the right. Decide where you would short a stock after the 3S pattern. Then move the sheet to the right and see where you would cover the short. How did you do? Practice on stocks you follow to get comfortable with the idea. Hone your skills and test your trading technique on paper before trying it in the marketplace with real money. The 3S pattern is a risky way to short a stock, but it is easy to do. The tough part is making money doing it. As I mentioned before, if you own the stock (a long holding) and it announces surprisingly good same-store sales, use a stop to protect yourself. Raise your stop until a declining price takes you out. All stocks tumble eventually, so a stop-loss order is a good way to lock in profits. For Best Performance The following list includes tips and observations to help you select patterns with improved performance. Refer to the associated table for more information on each tip. • Use the identification guidelines to select a 3S pattern. Those with a wider daily trading range do better and show smaller failure rates— Table 61.1. • Trade with the trend. Most patterns act as continuations of the upward price trend, but reversals outperform in a bull market—Table 61.2. • Busted patterns may make shorting a 3S pattern easier—Table 61.2. • Avoid this pattern in a bear market as 27% fail to rise more than 5%, and 54% do not make a 10% rise—Table 61.3. • Select 3S patterns that occur within a third of the yearly low—Table 61.4. • Performance suffers after a throwback in a bull market, so check for overhead resistance before trading—Table 61.4. • Be prepared to take profits quickly. Almost half (44%) of the bear market patterns reach the ultimate high in the first week—Table 61.5. • Tall patterns perform better than short ones—Table 61.6. 4366_62.qxd 2/23/05 12:27 PM Page 934 62 Stock Downgrades RESULTS SNAPSHOT Upward Breakouts Event A broker announces a downgrade and price rises for a week before tumbling.

In 39% of the cases I looked at, price climbs! However, the price usually did not climb for long and when it finally tumbled, it dropped at least 30%.
