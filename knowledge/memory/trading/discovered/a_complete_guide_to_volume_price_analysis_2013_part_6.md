explained he was searching for an elite group of traders. However, spaces were limited and only a select few would be taken and trained. Like many others there I wanted to join, and happily paid my £5,000 for a two week course, grateful to have been accepted for this ‘once in a lifetime opportunity’. If all the above sounds slightly bizarre, it was, but I felt confident because Albert had been endorsed by a very reputable newspaper, and I was anxious to learn. During the two week course we had to write an essay and we were encouraged to read Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre, which is a thinly disguised biography of Jesse Livermore. A book all traders and investors should read. Throughout the two weeks, the over-riding message was that all financial markets are manipulated in one way or another. And the only way to know whether a price move was genuine or false was by using volume. Volume cannot be hidden. It is there for everyone to see. I was so convinced by the volume story that I also persuaded my husband, David to take Albert’s course. With hindsight the costs were outrageous as the course could have been condensed into a couple of days. However, David and I took the basic principles of price and volume and since then, have integrated them into our own trading and investing methodology. In the intervening years, we have successfully traded virtually every market, and for the past five years have shared our knowledge and experience across our network of 70 websites. This book now gives us the opportunity to pass on this knowledge in more detail to the next generation of traders and investors, of which I hope you will be one. Chapter One There's Nothing New in Trading Nihil sub sole (there is nothing new under the sun) Ecclesiastes 1:9 Let me start if I may with a book I have read, many, many times, and was the 'course book' recommended to us by Albert as we sat, innocent and expectant on that first morning, clutching this book in our hands. The book in question was Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, written by Edwin Lefevre and published in 1923. It is an autobiography of one of the iconic traders of the past, Jesse Livermore, and is as relevant today, as it was then. But one quote in particular stands out for me, and it is this: “there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again” This in essence sums up volume, and Volume Price Analysis. If you are expecting some new and exciting approach to trading, you will be disappointed. The foundations of Volume Price Analysis are so deeply rooted in the financial markets, that it is extraordinary to me how few traders accept the logic of what we see every day. It is a technique which has been around for over 100 years. It was the foundation stone on which huge personal fortunes were created, and iconic institutions built. Now at this point you may be
