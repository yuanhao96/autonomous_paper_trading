Chapter 1 The Covered-Write As these examples show, rising implied volatility works against a coveredwrite, while falling implied volatility works in favor of a covered-write. Theta Theta is used to describe the sensitivity of an option’s theoretical value to the passage of time. It is usually expressed as the number of points that are lost from one day’s time decay. Long option positions have a negative theta, and short option positions have a positive theta. Because a coveredwrite has a short call as its option component, it will always have a positive theta. As mentioned above in “Strategy Overview,” all options are composed of intrinsic value and extrinsic value, and as time passes, the extrinsic value begins to decay. At expiration, the extrinsic value is gone, and an option is either in-the-money and has intrinsic value, or it expires worthless. This means that, all else being equal, the theoretical value of an option should fall by some amount every day. However, this amount varies because the rate at which extrinsic value decays is not linear and is itself dependent on other market factors, especially time to expiration and moneyness, as can be seen in Figure 1.7: –90 90 strike –80 100 strike –70 110 strike –60 Theta 12 –50 –40 –30 –20 –10 0 5 15 30 60 90 120 150 Days to Expiry Figure 1.7 Theta vs. Time to Expiration We can see in the figure that the theta of all long-dated options is low and is very similar for the 90, 100, and 110 strike calls. As time moves forward toward expiration, time decay begins to accelerate and the theta for all of the options begins to rise. Then, as expiration approaches, the in- and out-of-the-money calls (the 90 and 110 strike calls) lose their extrinsic value early, and their thetas begin to decline. Notice, however, that the theta of the 100 strike call, which is the at-the-money option, begins to accelerate. Heading into expiration, when the surrounding in- and out-of-the-money options no longer have extrinsic value to lose, the decay of the at-the-money option will continue to accelerate. Investment Objectives Example An investor has a covered-write position consisting of 100 shares of long stock at $100.00 and short one 100 strike call at $5.00. The call has a theta of 0.02. With the stock unchanged and implied volatility unchanged, what is the change in value of the overall position if: Five trading days pass . . . The price of the call will change from $5.00 to $4.90 ($5.00  5  0.02), so the value of the position will change accordingly: Initial Position Value New Position Value Stock price $100.00 Stock price $100.00  Call price $5.00  Call price $4.90 Position value $95.00 Position value $95.10 As this example shows, time decay works in favor of a covered-write. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES As mentioned earlier in “Strategy Overview,” the covered-write strategy is a neutral to mildly bullish strategy. The main objectives of a covered-write are the generation of income and limited downside protection. Every covered-write is a mixture of both and, depending on how the investor structures the trade, that is, which strike price and expiration cycle are chosen, the trade will be more of one and less of the other. It is also extremely important to distinguish between the covered-write as a long-term, systematic strategy, and the covered-write as a short-term trade. Covered-Write as a Long-Term Strategy Investors who use the covered-write as a long-term strategy usually have a core portfolio of stocks that—up or down, better or worse—they will hold. They systematically write calls against the stocks in the portfolio to help generate income, and, over time, lower the cost basis of the portfolio. Even though the written calls provide some downside protection for the portfolio, these investors are not as sensitive to downside risk because they will be holding the portfolio regardless of whether the market rises or falls in the short-term. Covered-Write as a Short-Term Trading Strategy The investor who uses the covered-write as a short-term trading strategy usually purchases the stock specifically for the purpose of writing a call against it and creating a strategy. Many times this trade is executed as a spread on an exchange known as a buy-write. The stock is not part of a longterm core portfolio, and, therefore, the short-term covered-write investor is 13 14
