Analysis that has been published since; great technical thinking is just that whether it is expressed in 1920, 1940, 1997 or at any other time. Such is the case with this book by Schabacker, for it, like many of the great works of the past, is a worthy addition to any technical analyst’s personal library or any market library. It is our belief that such great classics with their timeless analytical knowledge should never be allowed to disappear from the technical scene, if possible. It is to this end that Pitman Publishing, publishers of this Master Class Series, will be making many of these very rare works available again with an increasing number of additions to this series of great classical writings from the “Golden Age of Technical Analysis,” that very productive period between 1922 and 1957. Returning to the post-World War II period, it would appear the investment world was open to that one vital analytical work turning up to give this recovery period a boost. History has shown that Edwards and Magee were the boost-givers. Delving into their book we find it is divided into two main parts; Part One forms the bulk of the book and contains the main subject matter which is the descriptions contributed by Mr Edwards in his coverage on reversal, consolidation, and continuation patterns, trends, trend line action, support and resistance levels, and other areas of technical price action. The shorter Part Two by Mr Magee concentrates on the practical applications of what to do in the markets and when. While Part Two includes much in the way of general investment and trading knowledge that has been covered in many books before and since, it is Part One that made the difference in 1948. In Part One both private investors and professional analysts were presented with a compendium of chart patterns, formations, and technical action. If they had studied conscientiously and applied the knowledge extensively, they would have had some – xii – EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION excellent tools at hand to analyze skillfully any chart that they scrutinized in the light of the tenets of Technical Analysis. As fine and comprehensive as the Edwards and Magee work is, a careful reading of the introduction and similar statements on the book’s cover reveals their debt to Mr Schabacker. Their candor and honesty is to be admired for they freely state that they did not develop or create the many facets of Technical Analysis which they were passing on to a new generation. What their excellent work did accomplish was to save for posterity the vital creative and developmental work of their guiding light who had passed away some ten years earlier, and in so doing they educated many thousands in this new-to-them art of chart analysis. This takes us to a name now unknown to almost all Technical Analysis devotees and cognoscenti around the globe, the mentor of Edwards and Magee, Richard W. Schabacker. For it was from Schabacker’s “pioneering research,” as pointed out by Edwards, that the
