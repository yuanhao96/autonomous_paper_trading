life was based on interviews with his family, personal papers, newspaper accounts, and Livermore’s own writings. Some poetic license was taken in recreating dialogue to paint a more vibrant picture of Jesse Livermore, the man, and his times. In certain parts of the book I have replicated conversations as they were told to me by family members. And I think you will agree, after reading this book, that there never was another stock market speculator like Jesse Livermore. 8467_Smitten_fm_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:32 PM Page xii 8467_Smitten_fm_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:32 PM Page xiii Acknowledgments Special thanks to Paul Livermore for his kind cooperation in going back in time in such great detail to revisit a sometimes painful past and to Paul’s beautiful wife, Ann, who was so gracious with her time. Thanks to Patricia Livermore, who also had to travel back to the years she was married to Jesse Livermore Jr. and relive so much heartbreak, tragedy, and sorrow.

Also thanks must go to my fabulous daughter, Kelley Smitten, for her constant support and help in editing this book. I also must thank Ed Dobson at Trader’s Press for his great encouragement during preparation of the original edition of this book. Ed shares with me, and many other people, an endless fascination with Livermore’s life and times. Thanks to Debi Murray of the Historical Society of Palm Beach County for guiding me through the society’s precious archives and letting me have a glimpse into Palm Beach life at the turn of the last century. Finally, thanks to Jesse Livermore for trying to do the impossible—beat the game and master the stock market. 8467_Smitten_fm_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:32 PM Page xiv 8467_Smitten_01_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:38 PM Page 1 * chapter one * The Great Bear of Wall Street Chaos is come again.

Policemen on horseback and detectives in uniform attempted to keep the mob clear of the entrance to the New York Stock Exchange, but it was no use; every time they succeeded in opening a pathway, the jostling crowd immediately closed ranks again. Inside, on the floor of the exchange, one could actually feel the tension and fear in the air as the hands of the clock crawled toward 10:00 and the opening gong. Less than a week earlier on Black Thursday, the stock market had suffered the most disastrous decline in its history, and the staggering plunge of prices on the following Monday afternoon had only increased the prevailing sense of panic. In broker’s rooms across the country, investors visited nervously and coughed and shifted their feet as they stood and stared in hypnotic fascination at the silent stock ticker, the mechanical courier
