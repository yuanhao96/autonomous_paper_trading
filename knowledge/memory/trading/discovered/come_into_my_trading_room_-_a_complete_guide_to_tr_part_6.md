Chapter 8, “The Organized Trader”). Add two columns to your spreadsheet. Use the first to record the height of the channel when you enter the trade. Use the second to calculate what percentage of that channel you’ve grabbed exiting that trade. Keep monitoring your grades to see whether your performance is improving or deteriorating, steady or erratic. Back in college, professors used to grade you. Now you can use channels to find out your grades and become a better trader. What Markets to Trade? Channels can help us decide which stocks or futures to trade and which to leave alone. A stock may have great fundamentals or beautiful technical signals, but measure its channel before you put on a trade. It’ll show you whether the swings are wide enough to be worth trading. You may look at a volatile stock whose channel height is 30 points. If you are an A trader, you should be able to get 30%, or 9 points, out of a trade. That will be more than enough to pay commissions, cover slippage, and leave you with profits. On the other hand, if you look at an inexpensive stock whose channel is only 5 points high, then an A trader would be shooting for a paltry 1.5-point gain. That would leave you with next to nothing after commissions and slippage—leave that stock alone, no matter how good it looks. What if your performance slips a bit or the market throws you a curve? What if you earn only a C and take only 10% out of a channel? The first 100 THE THREE M’S OF SUCCESSFUL TRADING stock, with its 30-point channel, will return 3 points profit—enough to make some money after expenses. The stock with a 5-point channel will return only half a point, and commissions and slippage may push you into negative territory! Beginners are often seduced by low-priced stocks with strong technical patterns. They cannot understand why they keep losing money. When there is no room for the stock to swing, a trader can’t win. A good technical analyst who was slowly losing money called me for a consultation. When I asked him to fax me his charts, he showed $10 and $15 stocks whose channels were only $2 to $4 tall. There was simply no room for price swings, while commissions, slippage, and expenses continued to chip away at his equity. If you’re going to support yourself by fishing, find a channel where the fish are big enough. Once you become interested in a new stock, draw a channel to see whether it’s wide enough to trade. We like to think of ourselves as A traders and all-around A people, but what if you pull only a C trade? If you take only 10 percent out of this channel, will it be worth trading? Beginning traders should leave alone any stock whose channel is narrower than 10 points, meaning that a C trader can take one point out of it. A few traders said to me it was OK to trade stocks with narrrow channels, as long as one increased trading size. They think that trading 10,000 shares in a three-point channel is the same as trading 1,000 shares in a 30-point channel, but it is not, because the ratio of slippage to channel is much higher in narrow channels, raising the external barrier to victory. Low-priced stocks with slender channels can make good investments. Think of Peter Lynch, a famous money manager, looking for his elusive 10-bagger, a stock that goes up 10-fold. A $5 stock is much more likely to rise to $50 than an $80 stock to rally to $800. But those are investments, not trades. As a trader, you are looking to take advantage of short-term swings. That is why you should not waste your energy on any stock whose channel is narrow. The Rewards of Day-Trading Day-trading seems deceptively easy, and beginners flock to it like moths to a flame. Amateurs look at intraday charts and see strong rallies and steep declines. It looks like the money is there for the picking by any sharp-witted individual with a computer, a modem, and a live data feed. Day-trading firms make fortunes in commissions. They promote day-trading because they need to replace the great majority of customers who flame out. The firms hide customer statistics from the public, but in the year 2000 state regulators in Massachusetts subpoenaed records which showed that after 6 months only 16% of day-traders made money. METHOD—TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 101 There is an old Russian saying: “your elbow is near, yet you can’t bite it.” Try it now—stretch your neck, bend your arm, go for it. So near, yet so far. It’s the same with day-trading—the money is right in front of your face, yet you keep missing it by a few ticks. Why do so many people lose so much money day-trading? There is simply not enough height in intraday channels to make profits. Using channels to select trades sends a powerful message to day-traders. Look at a few popular actively traded stocks—YHOO, AMZN, and AOL are in the forefront of public attention on the day I write this. The figures are likely to change by the time you read this book, but today I get the following numbers for channel heights on their daily and five-minute charts: Daily channel A-level trader (30%) C-level trader (10%) Fiveminute channel A-level trader (30%) C-level trader (10%) AOL 20 6 2 3 0.9 0.3 AMZN 21 6.3 2.1 3 0.9 0.3 YHOO 54 16.2 5.4 7 2.1 0.7 A swing trader who uses daily charts to buy and hold for a few days can do very well in these active stocks. He can really clean up if he is an A-level trader, but even if he is a C trader, taking 10% out of a channel, he can stay afloat while he’s learning. A person who day-trades the same stocks must be a straight-A trader in order to survive. Anything less, and he’ll be eaten alive by slippage, commissions, and expenses. I can hear a howl of protests from the crowd of vendors who make a good living from day-trading—brokers, software dealers, system sellers, etc. They can roll out their examples of successful day-traders, as if that proves anything! Brilliant day-traders do exist, and I am friends with a handful of them myself. Sadly, it’s a very small handful. The chances of
