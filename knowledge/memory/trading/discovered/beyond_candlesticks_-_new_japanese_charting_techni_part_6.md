Chapter 4 focuses on how the overall technical picture is more important than a single candle pattern. Notes lHoshii, Kazutaka,p.

For over L here is a Japanesesaying, a century, the claws of Japanesetechnical analysis, that is candlestick charts, were a secrethidden from the western world. is For those new to the exciting field of candlestickcharts, candlestick the term used for Japan's most popular and oldest form of technical analysis.They are older than Western point and figure and bar charts. Amazingly, candlestickcharting techniques,used for generationsin the Far East, were virtually unknown to the West until I revealed them in ChartingTechniques. my first book, lapaneseCandlestick I am pleased and proud that my first book has been credited with revolutionizing technical analysis by igniting the flames of interest in the candles. Before its publication, few people in the West had ever heard of a candle chart. Now, candle charting techniquesare among the most discussedform of technical analysis in the world! Interest in candle charts has become so intense that the World Bank in Washington, DC asked me to addressthem on the subject.The worldwide interest in these previously secret techniques are reflected in the financial headlines below: FF TradingSystem" AncientJapanese lnaestor-"Revealed! lnstitutional Light Traders'Path" WallStreetloumal-"lapan's Candlesticks ChartingComesof Age" Euroweek-"Candlestick Candles Equitylnternational-"Candlestick Charting-A New Languagefor the west" Reuters-"Candlesticks Light New Pathfor WesternChartists,, For over 70 years, the standard charting tools in the west have been bar charts and point and figure charts. Yet, within a short time, candle charts have now joined these as a basic charting tool. The rapidity with which this has happened is a direct reflection of the candle's popularity and value. The groundswell of interest in the candlestickcharting has becomea topic in the media. A TV show, TechTalk, on the business news cable station CNBC is hosted by the famous technician, fohn Murphy. john told me that a viewer once called and asked him, "What are those charts that look like hot dogs?" What an interestingand amusingidea, I thought, to Americanize these charts by referring to them as hot dog charts. But I guess the term "candle chart," thankfully, is here to stay. I have had many wonderful compliments from famous traders and analysts.However, the most endearing compliment came from a woman who wrote, "lf you ever have a down day, just remember there's a nice little grandmother in Missouri who's in awe of your accomplishments." This letter, besidesbeing so gracious, illustrates the universal appeal of candles-from traders at the World Bank to a grandmother in Missouri. The reason for the popularity of candlestick analysis is easy to understand. They can be melded with any other form of technicalanalysis, they are applicable to any of the markets to which technical analysis is applied, and they provide market insights not availableanywhere else. Why this book? A renowned 16th-centurysamurai swordsman stated that "learning is the gate, not the house. You first have to go through the gate to get to the house." My other book, lapaneseCandlestickCharting Techniques,took you to the gate. This book takes you to the house and has many new, exciting, and effective techniques to improve your trading, investing, or hedging. Japanesecharting was considereda secret.However, I have managed to pry open the "secrets of the Orient" by exchangingideas with many Japanesetraderswho use candlesand by having many hundreds of pages translatedfrom ]apaneseinto English. Lin Yutang, a noted Chinesephilosopher, sagely noted that one gets a different flavor from reading the same book at different stagesin life. Therefore, he says, all great books can be read with profit and pleasurea second time; I have found this to be true. In the time since the publication of my first book, I have reread my original candlestick documents and have gleaned new insights. In addition, I have obtained and translated new ]apanesematerial, have ex- Overuiew panded my dialogue with more fapanesetechnicians and, of course, have continued to learn from my use of candles. I reveal these new and valuable insights in this book. My first book focused on the futures markets. The candles have now become so important that their popularity has spilled over from futures into stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets from around the world. As a result, this book will have many more of the charts than did my other book. At times, a single candle line can be important. The Japanesehave a saying, "With the fall of one leaf we know that autumn has come to the world." In this sense,a single candle line may be the first sign of a market turn. In this book, I will show how to use individual candle lines to obtain clues about the market's health. It has been very exciting to see the intense interest sparked by the candles. However, it is often forgotten that the emergenceof a candle pattern is but one aspectof trading. Other aspects,such as the risk and reward ratio of a potential trade and monitoring where the candle pattern appearsin the overall technical picture, must also be considered.This is so important that I have devoted a chapter to these aspects. In my continuing studies of ]apanese trading techniques, I have uncovered three charting methods that are very PoPular in ]apan, yet are unknown to the West. These charting techniques are called three-line break charts, kagi charts, and renko charts. They are revealed in
