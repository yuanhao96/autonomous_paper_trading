Yet about 90 percent of traders lose money. This book is designed to create profitable traders. Can you make a living trading forex? Yes! And no. Let me explain. It is common wisdom that about 90 percent of traders lose money trading forex, about 5 percent break even, and about 5 percent make money. I have not seen any scientific evidence that this is true but I have talked to senior executives at brokerage houses and they tell me that this is a rough guide to what happens to traders. My own experience as a senior executive in the futures and options industry also confirms the same dreary results. There was a study by the federal government back in the 1960s of futures traders and they found that futures traders had those same statistics. However, the underlying data were not so dismal. It was true that 90 percent lost money, but that was after commissions. They actually had about a 7 percent return on their investment before commissions. The main reason that they were losing was commissions. The theory back then was that the 7 percent gain was the equivalent of an insurance premium that commercial companies paid to speculators to take over the risk of the commercials. Trading forex does not incur any commissions (and futures commissions are much lower now) so I doubt that this factor is so important anymore. However, forex does have other transaction costs in the form of the bid/ask spread. The cost of buying at the ask and selling at the bid on every trade is a significant drag on performance over a given year. Let’s assume a $10,000 account trading mini-contracts. Let’s further assume that there is a 3 pip bid/ask spread for each trade. Now assume that we do almost one trade per day, or 250 trades per year. That comes to a $750 expense off the top of trading. We have to overcome that vig each T xi xii PREFACE year to make a profit. We effectively start out in the hole by 7.5 percent when we start the year trading. We need to make at least 7.5 percent profit just to break even. I think those assumptions are similar to many traders’. Take a look at your own experience to see where you stand and how much headwind you have to overcome to break even. It might actually be worse than that. The most common form of forex trading is spot forex through a retail forex broker such as FXCM or Sterling Gent. Brokers take an additional profit from the roll every day. I’ll explain what the roll is in
