Chapter 23). And then, paradigms. Paradigms, as everyone should know by now, are the last refuge of a fundamentalist when all other explanations fail. Paradigm Changes Whenever the markets, as they did at the end of the 20th century, depart from the commonly accepted algorithms for determining what their prices ought to be, fundamentalists (those analysts and investors who believe they can determine value from such fixed verities as earnings, cash flow, etc.) are confronted with new paradigms. Are stock prices (values) to be determined by dividing price by earnings to establish a reasonable price/earnings (p/e) ratio? Or should sales be used, or cash flow, or the phase of the moon, or — in the late 1990s, should losses be multiplied by price to determine the value of the stock? Technicians are not obliged to worry about this kind of financial legerdemain. The stock is worth what it can be sold for today in the market. The Crystal Ball Investors will get smarter and smarter, starting with those who learn what this book has to say. The professionals will stay one step ahead of them, because they are preternaturally cunning and because they spend all their time figuring out how to keep ahead of the public, but the gap will narrow. Software and hardware will continue to advance, but not get any smarter. Mechanical systems will work well in some areas, and not in others. Mechanical systems are only as good as the engineer who designs them and the mechanic who maintains them. Buying systems is buying trouble. Everyone should find his own method (usually some variant of the Magee method, in my opinion). All good things will end. All bad things will end. The bag of tricks with which the insiders bilk the public will get smaller and smaller. New and ingenious procedures will be developed by the insiders. The well of human naiveté is bottomless. For every one educated, a new one will be born in a New York minute. It is deeply disturbing at the turn of the century that the owners of the NASDAQ and the NYSE should be thinking of going AU3772_C000.fm Page 13 Tuesday, November 21, 2006 1:50 PM public. Could there be any more ominous sign that enormous changes are about to occur? Vigorous development of the systems, methods, procedures, and philosophy outlined in this book is about the only protective shield I know of to guard against inimical change. W.H.C.

Every critic and reader has his or her (cf. Note on Gender) opinion as to how revision should be done — whether the authors’ original text should be invisibly changed as though they had written the book in 2000 instead of 1948 and were omniscient, or whether errors and anachronisms were to be lovingly preserved, or footnoted, or… etc., etc. (I have preserved Magee’s favorite usage of “etc., etc., etc.” against the protestation of generations of English composition teachers because I like its evocation of an ever-expanding universe.) Notwithstanding every reader’s having an opinion, I am certain all critics will be delighted with the practices followed in this 3rd millennium edition of the most important book on technical analysis written in the 2nd millennium. Integrity of the Original Text By and large, the 5th edition has been the source of the authors’ original text. Amazingly, almost no stylistic or clarifying emendation has been necessary to that edition. This is a tribute to the clarity, style, and content of the original — one might almost say awesome, if the word were not in such currency on “Saturday Night Live” and the “Comedy Channel.” Considering that it was written in the middle of the last century, and considering its complex subject, and considering that the markets were one tenth of their present complexity, awesome may be the appropriate word. No change or update has been necessary to the technical observations and analysis. They are as definitive today as they were in 1950. While I have preserved the authors’ original intent and text, I have taken the liberty of rearranging some of the chapters. Novices wishing to learn manual charting will find the appropriate chapters moved to appendices at the back of the book, along with the chapters on Composite Leverage and Sensitivity Indexes. About Apparent Anachronisms Critics with limited understanding of long-term trading success may think that discussions of “what happened in 1929” or “charts of ancient history from 1946” have no relevance to the markets of the present millennium. They will point out that AT&T no longer exists in that form, that the New Haven AU3772_C000.fm Page 16 Tuesday, November 21, 2006 1:50 PM has long since ceased to exist as a stock, that many charts are records of long-buried skeletons. This neglects the value of the charts as metaphor. It ignores their representations of human behavior in the markets which will be replicated tomorrow in some stock named today.com or willtheynevergetit.com. Even more important, it ignores the significance of the past to trading in the present. I cite here material from Jack Schwager’s illuminating book, The New Wizards of Wall Street. Schwager, in conversation with Al Weiss: “Precisely how far back did you go in your chart studies?” Answer: “It varied with the individual market and the available charts. In the case of the grain markets, I was able to go back as far as the 1840s.” “Was it really necessary to go back that far?” Answer: “Absolutely. One of the keys in longterm chart analysis is realizing that markets behave differently in different economic cycles. Recognizing these repeating and shifting long-term patterns requires lots of history. Identifying where you are in an economic cycle — say, an inflationary phase vs. a
