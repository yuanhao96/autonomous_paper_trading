Chapter 4 Volatility Breakouts The Momentum Breakthrough Necessity may, or may not, be the mother of nvention, but for sure it is the fatber of taking chances. Momentum is one of the five concepts that can bring us short-term trading profits. It is what Newton was talking about when he said an object once Set in motion tends to stay in motion. So it is with stocks and commodities: once price starts to move, it will most likely keep going that direction. There are almost as many ways to measure momentum as there are traders. I will not delve into all of them, just the ones I have found to work, and the concept, I trade with. There are other approaches; any one with a fertile mind should be able to go past where I have. Mathematicians, this is the chapter where you can bring all your techniques, concepts, and formulas to play. This is where you have a distinct advantage over those of us limited to basic addition. multiplication, and subtraction. I doubt that anyone fully understood how the markets work until the mid-1980s. Sure, we knew about trend; about overbought and oversold markets; about a few patterns, seasonal influences, fundamentals, and the like But we really did not know what caused trend or, more correctly put. how it began and ended. 57 58 We do now and it is time for you to learn this fundamental truism of price structure and movement. Trends are set in motion by what I call "explosions of price activity." Succinctly, if price, in one hour, day, week, month (pick your time frame for trend identification) has an explosive move up, or down, the market will continue in that direction until there is an equal or greater explosive move in the opposite direction. This has come to be known as an expansion in volatility and verbally captured by the phrase coined by Doug Brie "volatility breakout," based on my early 1980 work. It gets down to this, price has an explosive breakout, up or down, from a center point. That is what sets or establishes the trend. Thus we have two problems; first, what do we mean by an explosive breakout (how much of an up or down move), and second, from what point do we measure this expansion in price? Let's start with the beginning, what set of data should we use to measure the expansion? Since my working thesis is that we need a very quick explosion of price change I like to use daily range values-the difference between the day's high and close. This value shows how volatile the market has been each and every day. It is when this volatility increases out of recent proportion that trends change. There are several ways of taking this measure. You might use the average range for the last X number of days, various swing points, and the like. Bi and large though, I have found that using just yesterday's range as my cornparison of volatility works wonders. Let's say yesterday's range was 12 cents in Wheat. If today's range exceeds that range by some percentage. the trend probably changed, at least that is the way to wager. This would be a clear in dication price has had a new impetus driving it in a direction, and price. Like any object once set in motion, tends to stay in the direction of that motion. It is really as simple as that, a pickup in range, substantially greater than yesterday's range implies a change in the current market direction. That also leads to the second problem: From what point do we measure the expansive move, up or down? most traders think we should measure from today's closing price. That is typical thinking; we usually compare price change from close to close. But it is not the correct answer. I will get to that in a moment, but first let's consider points from which to measure this expansion: we could use the close, the average price of the current day, or perhaps today's high for a buy or today's low for a sell. Let's look at the very best results of several nonrelated commodities using a variety of points for measuring the explosion. Table 4.1 shows buying tomorrow at a percentage of today's range added to today's close. The data, listed in order, shows the commodity, percentage of range, dollar profit. accuracy, and average profit per trade. 59 In this table I have even provided the best percent of the previous day's range to add to the close for a buy and to subtract for a sell. In this, and all data shown, no stop was used and you were always long short. This table shows only the best percent volatility add-ons for buys and subtracts for sells; and again in the data for Table 4.1, we added the volatility factor or filter to the previous day's close. Using cattle as an example, if price rallied 70 percent of the previous day's range above the close, we bought and sold short at 50 percent of the day's range subtracted from the close. Next, look at buying tomorrow at a percentage of yesterday's range added to yesterday's high or subtracting that same amount from yesterday's low for a sell signal (see Table 4.2). 60 Although this concept makes money, again on the best-fit basis, it does not do as well as adding or subtracting a value from the close. A simple way to compare the results is to determine the size of the average profit per trade. In the add-to-the-close method, it is $327 a trade and $313 for the add-to-the-high and subtract-from-the-low technique. The next set of data adds a percentage of today's range to tomorrow's open and buys there for a long entry or subtracts a percentage of today's range from the opening for a sell. The results appear in Table 4.3. A careful look at the data shows us the average profit per trade is higher at $389 and the accuracy is also higher; five commodities in this test showed an accuracy of 50 percent or higher while none of them did in the first two tests. My conclusion is that the best point to add or subtract a volatility expansion value to is tomorrow's open. I have always traded this technique with the open, but in preparation for this book, I did the preceding tests to see whether my ju
