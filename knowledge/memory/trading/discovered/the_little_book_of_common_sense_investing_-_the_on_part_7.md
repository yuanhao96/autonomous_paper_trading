Chapter 4, the 2.5 percent penalty incurred by the average fund because of costs was huge. But the dual penalties of faulty timing and adverse selection were even larger. Exhibit 5.1 shows that $10,000 invested in the index fund grew to $170,800; in the average equity fund, to $98,200—just 57 percent of what was there for the taking. But the compound return earned by the average fund investor tumbled to $48,200, a stunning 28 percent of the return on the simple index fund. And once again, the value of all those dollars tumbles because we must take inflation into account. The index fund real return drops to 9.0 percent per year, but the real return of the average fund investor plummets to just 4.0 percent.

Truth told, it’s hard to imagine such a staggering gap, but facts are facts. While the data clearly indicate that fund investor returns fell well short of fund returns, there is no way to be precise about the exact shortfall.* But the point of this examination of the returns earned by the stock market, the average fund, * Estimate of the gap was based on the difference between the 10-year timeweighted returns on the 200 largest mutual funds in 1999 and their actual dollar-weighted returns during the same period. THE GRAND ILLUSION [53] and the average fund owner is not precision, but direction. Whatever the precise data, the evidence is compelling that equity fund returns lag the stock market by a substantial amount, largely accounted for by their costs, and that fund investor returns lag fund returns by an even larger amount.  Inflamed by heady optimism and greed, and enticed by the wiles of mutual fund marketers, investors poured their savings into equity funds at the bull market peak. What explains this shocking lag? Simply put, counterproductive market timing and fund selection. First, shareholders investing in equity funds paid a heavy timing penalty. They invested too little of their savings in equity funds during the 1980s and early 1990s when stocks represented good values. Then, inflamed by the heady optimism and greed of the era and enticed by the wiles of mutual fund marketers as the bull market neared its peak, they poured too much of their savings into equity funds. Second, they paid a selection penalty, pouring their money into the market not only at the wrong time but into the wrong funds. In both failures, investors simply failed to practice what common sense would have told them. This lag effect was amazingly pervasive. In the past decade, the returns provided to investors by 198 of the [54] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING 200 most popular equity funds of 1996 to 2000 were lower than the returns that they reported to investors! This lag was especially evident during the “new economy” craze of the late 1990s. Then, the fund industry organized more and more funds, usually funds that carried considerably higher risk than the stock market itself, and magnified the problem by heavily advertising the eyecatching past returns earned by its hottest funds. As the market soared, investors poured ever larger sums of money into equity funds. They invested a net total of only $18 billion in 1990 when stocks were cheap, but $420 billion in 1999 and 2000, when stocks were overvalued (Exhibit 5.2). What’s more, they also chose overwhelmingly the highest-risk growth funds, to the virtual exclusion of more conservative value-oriented funds. While only 20 percent of their money went into risky aggressive growth funds in 1990, they poured fully 95 percent into such funds when they peaked during 1999 and early 2000. After the fall, when it was too late, investor purchases dried up to as little as $50 billion in 2002, when the market hit bottom. They also pulled their money out of growth funds and turned, too late, to value funds. The problems of counterproductive market timing and unwise fund selection can be illustrated by observing the experience of the most popular growth funds of five giant fund families with the largest cash inflows, altogether more THE GRAND ILLUSION EXHIBIT 5.2 The Timing and Selection Penalties: Net Flow into Equity Funds Nasdaq 4500 350 300 Net Flow ($ Billions) 250 [55] Aggressive Equity 4000 Other Equity 3500 Nasdaq Index 3000 200 2500 150 2000 100 1500 50 1000 0 1000 −50 0 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 than $150 billion between 1996 and 2000 inclusive (Exhibit 5.3). During those five years, these aggressive funds provided spectacular records—annual returns averaging 21 percent per year, well above even the outstanding return of 18.4 percent on the S&P 500 Index fund. But during the five years that followed, in 2001 through 2005, retribution followed. While the index fund eked out a small gain (less than 1 percent per year), the returns of these aggressive, risk-laden funds tumbled into negative territory. For the full 10 years, taking into account both their rise and their fall, the returns reported by these aggressive funds were actually quite acceptable—an average of 7.8 [56] 1995 –2000 Total 20.1% 21.6 24.8 20.7 17.6 21.0% 18.4% Alliance Bernstein Growth Fidelity Growth Janus Growth MFS Growth Putnam Growth Average Vanguard Index 500 10-Year Fund 6.7% 8.8 9.8 7.3 6.5 7.8% 9.1% 2000 –2005 Total −5.2% −2.5 −3.3 −4.6 −3.7 −3.9% 0.5% Annual Return −0.5% 7.1% −7.6% 3.4 1.4 −1.1 1.7 10-Year Shareholder −8.3% −2.0% −14.3% −5.5 −8.5 −8.4 −4.8 10-Year Sharehol
