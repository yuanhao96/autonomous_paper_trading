Chapter 1 | Historical Background Toward this end, the ECNs offer trading overlays so that participants can move seamlessly from requesting quotes to executing trades. Interbank trades are settled by the Continuous Linked Settlement Bank (CLS). Through a complex system of credit lines and payment protocols, this bank is able to limit one of the most basic risks of forex: counterparty risk. This risk is present in any financial transaction and basically represents the possibility that one party to a financial transaction (in this case, a currency exchange) will not honor its obligation to the other. CLS processes trades for 17 major currencies and on behalf of 69 financial institutions, comprising more than half of all global forex activity. Since CLS settles trades daily and ensures that everyone gets paid, participants can effectively conduct a limitless number of forex trades. Without CLS, forex liquidity/volume would be significantly smaller. On behalf of their clients, brokers manually and electronically facilitate yet another level of trading. You can see from Figure 1-3 that telephone transactions (also known as voice broker) still account for a large portion of overall volume. For illiquid instruments and currency pairs, nonstandard contract sizes, unusual dates, and other circumstances, there is evidently still an important advantage to being able to speak with a broker. Phone execution also carries the added benefit of anonymity, which is important to some fund managers. The majority of broker executions (especially on the spot market) are conducted electronically. Since 2005, brokers have begun to grant indirect access to the interbank market to favored clients. So-called prime brokerage account holders are able to place trades on the interbank market via their brokers. Trades are settled in the name of the broker-dealer, not in the name of the client that places the trade. As seen in Figure 1-3, the interdealer market has suffered slightly, due to a rise in competition from platforms that facilitate trading directly between dealers and clients. In the United States, so-called customer direct trading represents a whopping 40% of overall volume. Most of this trading takes place on proprietary trading systems that have been developed by broker-dealers. Due to the explosion in volume over the last decade, a handful of the top broker-dealers account for more than $100 billion in daily volume. (See Figure 1-5.) As a result, it’s no longer necessary for large banks to rely completely on the interbank market. Instead, they have started to process trades internally, by directly matching their own Forex for Beginners customers’ buy and sell orders. Evidence suggests that only the largest and most complex orders (representing perhaps 20% of the total) are now funneled into the interbank market. Multi-dealer trading systems currently represent the smallest corner of the forex market. This category is poised to capture a growing chunk of volume over the upcoming decade, however, due to its growing attraction to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers (CTAs), and other high-frequency traders. The market is dominated by FX Connect (State Street), FX All, Currenex (State Street), and HotSpot FX (Knight Capital), with about a dozen others accounting for less than 30% of multi-dealer activity. Multi-dealer platforms are attractive to clients not only because of the liquidity, range of instruments, and currency pairs they offer, but also because of the sophistication of their software and the breadth of services that they perform. Many platforms are basically one-stop shops for institutional currency traders, offering automatic trading reconciliation, multi-asset trading, trading statistics, streaming quotes, and even credit guarantees. They earn money by assessing nominal fees ($10–20 per million traded) on every transaction. Retail represents the bottom tier of foreign exchange. The majority of retail forex volume is processed by a handful of retail aggregators. These aggregators work the same way as interbank broker-dealers. Sometimes they provide quotes from various brokers and “liquidity providers” and merely execute trades on behalf of their customers. Brokers that operate this way will profit by presenting their customers with a slightly wider spread (i.e., higher price for the buyer and a lower price for the seller) than with which their supplying interbank brokers originally presented them. Other retail aggregators execute trades internally by either matching up buyers with sellers or by taking the opposite side of the trade themselves. This type of aggregator is known as a dealing desk. As you can probably imagine, this latter approach is somewhat controversial. Given that the majority of retail traders lose money, it is profitable for the broker. As explained in
