You just need to correctly pick whether the value of the asset is going up (Call) or down (Put). Usually, these options expire in 15-30 minutes. For example, a trader forms a view that the price of gold will fall in a given period of time, and so places $100 in a put. If correct, s/he wins a fixed payout $175. It does not matter if the price of the asset falls $1 or $100 - the payout is the same. If the price of gold rises, however, the trader loses the entire amount of the investment - $100. Some brokers, however, let you minimize risks by choosing the payout and loss percentage you want. For example, you can choose to lose only 75% in the event that your view is incorrect. With such an option, you would also have to accept a lower win percentage.
