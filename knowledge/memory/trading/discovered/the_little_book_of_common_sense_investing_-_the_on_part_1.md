Chapter 5, if you are a typical investor in mutual funds, you’ve done even worse. If you don’t believe that is what most investors experience, please think for a moment, about the relentless rules of humble arithmetic. These iron rules define the game. As investors, all of us as a group earn the stock market’s return. As a group—I hope you’re sitting down for this astonishing revelation—we are average. Each extra return that one of us earns means that another of our fellow investors suffers a return shortfall of precisely the same dimension. Before the deduction of the costs of investing, beating the stock market is a zero-sum game. INTRODUCTION [XV] But the costs of playing the investment game both reduce the gains of the winners and increases the losses of the losers. So who wins? You know who wins. The man in the middle (actually, the men and women in the middle, the brokers, the investment bankers, the money managers, the marketers, the lawyers, the accountants, the operations departments of our financial system) is the only sure winner in the game of investing. Our financial croupiers always win. In the casino, the house always wins. In horse racing, the track always wins. In the powerball lottery, the state always wins. Investing is no different. After the deduction of the costs of investing, beating the stock market is a loser’s game. Yes, after the costs of financial intermediation—all those brokerage commissions, portfolio transaction costs, and fund operating expenses; all those investment management fees; all those advertising dollars and all those marketing schemes; and all those legal costs and custodial fees that we pay, day after day and year after year—beating the market is inevitably a game for losers. No matter how many books are published and promoted purporting to show how easy it is to win, investors fall short. Indeed, when we add the costs of these self-help investment books into the equation, it becomes even more of a loser’s game. [XVI] INTRODUCTION  Don’t allow a winner’s game to become a loser’s game. The wonderful magic of compounding returns that is reflected in the long-term productivity of American business, then, is translated into equally wonderful returns in the stock market. But those returns are overwhelmed by the powerful tyranny of compounding the costs of investing. For those who choose to play the game, the odds in favor of the successful achievement of superior returns are terrible. Simply playing the game consigns the average investor to a woeful shortfall to the returns generated by the stock market over the long term. Most investors in stocks think that they can avoid the pitfalls of investing by due diligence and knowledge, trading stocks with alacrity to stay one step ahead of the game. But while the investors who trade the least have a fighting chance of capturing the market’s return, those who trade the most are doomed to failure. An academic study showed that the most active one-fifth of all stock traders turned their portfolios over at the rate of more than 21 percent per month. While they earned the market return of 17.9 percent per year during the period 1990 to 1996, they incurred trading costs of about 6.5 percent, leaving them with an annual return of but 11.4 INTRODUCTION [XVII] percent, only two-thirds of the return in that strong market upsurge.  Fund investors are confident that they can easily select superior fund managers. They are wrong. Mutual fund investors, too, have inflated ideas of their own omniscience. They pick funds based on the recent performance superiority of fund managers, or even their long-term superiority, and hire advisers to help them do the same thing. But, the advisers do it with even less success (see Chapters 8, 9, and 10). Oblivious of the toll taken by costs, fund investors willingly pay heavy sales loads and incur excessive fund fees and expenses, and are unknowingly subjected to the substantial but hidden transaction costs incurred by funds as a result of their hyperactive portfolio turnover. Fund investors are confident that they can easily select superior fund managers. They are wrong. Contrarily, for those who invest and then drop out of the game and never pay a single unnecessary cost, the odds in favor of success are awesome. Why? Simply because they own businesses, and businesses as a group earn substantial returns on their capital and pay out dividends to their owners. Yes, many individual companies fail. Firms with flawed ideas and rigid strategies and weak managements ultimately [XVIII] INTRODUCTION fall victim to the creative destruction that is the hallmark of competitive capitalism, only to be succeeded by others.* But in the aggregate, businesses grow with the long-term growth of our vibrant economy. This book will tell you why you should stop contributing to the croupiers of the financial markets, who rake in something like $400 billion each year from you and your fellow investors. It will also tell you how easy it is to do just that: simply buy the entire stock market. Then, once you have bought your stocks, get out of the casino and stay out. Just hold the market portfolio forever. And that’s what the index fund does. This investment philosophy is not only simple and elegant. The arithmetic on which it is based is irrefutable. But it is not easy to follow its discipline. So long as we investors accept the status quo of today’s crazy-quilt financial market system; so long as we enjoy the excitement (however costly) of buying and selling stocks; so long as we fail to realize that there is a better way, such a philosophy will seem counterintuitive. But I ask you to carefully consider the impassioned message of this little book. When you do, you, too, will want to join the revolution and invest in a new, more economical, more efficient, even more honest way, a more productive way that will put your own interest first. * “Creative destruction” is the formulation of Joseph E. Schumpeter i
