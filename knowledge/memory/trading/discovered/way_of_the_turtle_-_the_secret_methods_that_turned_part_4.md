Chapter 2 discussed how cognitive biases provide trading opportunities in a theoretical sense. This chapter will discuss that notion in further detail by using actual price data. T Support and Resistance The concept of support and resistance is fundamental to almost all types of trading. Support and resistance is simply the tendency for prices not to exceed previous price levels. One can understand this concept most easily by examining its presence on a price chart (see Figure 6-1). • 75 • Copyright © 2007 by Curtis M. Faith.

All rights reserved worldwide. Support and resistance results from market behavior, which in turn is caused by three cognitive biases: anchoring, recency bias, and the disposition effect. Anchoring is the tendency to base price perceptions on readily available information. A recent new high or low becomes a new anchor against which each subsequent price is measured and compared. New prices are considered to be higher or lower in comparison to those anchor prices. The reason recent highs and lows are easy anchors is that they are simple to see on the charts and therefore are psychologically signiﬁcant to market participants. In Figure 6-1, under the label “Support 1,” a low price of about $1.13 becomes a new anchor shortly after that price is made and certainly after the price climbs to $1.20 over the next several days. It is the low point on the chart that will stand out for short-term day Falling Off the Edge • 77 traders and longer-term position traders alike. As the price descends back to the range of $1.15, over the days after the high at about $1.23, traders continue to think in terms of the previous but still recent $1.13 low. At $1.15 they will judge the price as low but not too low on the basis of a comparison with that anchor price at $1.13. Recency bias is the tendency for people to place greater importance on more recent data and experience. Since the low at $1.13 was recent, it will count more in a trader’s evaluation of the current price than will other previous lows. That low will have a greater meaning to the market participant because of this bias. How does this affect the support and resistance phenomenon? Imagine that you are a trader who wants to buy coffee. When the price ﬁrst went to $1.13, you might have wished or hoped that it would go even lower and therefore might not have purchased coffee at that price. As the price climbed to $1.23 over the next several days, you would have been very unhappy that you did not buy any coffee below $1.15 because you are now anchoring on that recent $1.13 low which becomes the basis for a more concrete sense of a “low” price. Thus, when the price drops below $1.15 a few days later, you will be much more likely to buy even though the price is the same as it was the last time the price was there a few days earlier. The effect of anchoring and the recency bias will cause you to consider any price below $1.15 as reasonably low and therefore a good price at which to buy. Since many market participants similarly consider a price below $1.15 as good, any pause in the price movement below that price probably will result in more buyers coming into the market. This inﬂux of new buyers at points of support creates a tendency for market prices to bounce off the price levels of previous highs and lows. 78 • Way of the Turtle The perception of most traders that support and resistance is a real phenomenon adds to the reality of its existence because the market behavior of those who believe in it by itself reinforces that phenomenon. If many traders believe that there will be signiﬁcant buying when a price drops to a certain level, they will be more inclined to believe that the price will rise once it reaches that level. This belief in and of itself will reduce their willingness to sell at or near that price since they will prefer to sell later, after the price has risen—because of the effect of support at the price. The belief in support and resistance causes it to become a self-fulﬁlling prophecy. The disposition effect is the tendency for traders to want to lock in proﬁts rather than let winning trades get larger. Traders’ fear of losing proﬁts grows stronger as those proﬁts rise. How does this affect support and resistance? Imagine that you were a trader who bought coffee in early August at 102 just after the end of the area labeled “Support 2” in Figure 6-1. When the price rose to 114 over the next several days, you probably would not have sold because the price moved so quickly in your favor that you would have believed that it might go as high as 120 or 125. Subsequently, when the price dropped to 105, you found yourself wishing that you had sold it over 110. The recent high would have had you thinking, “If the price gets over 114 again, I am going to sell this time.” Thus, when the price does in fact go back up to that level, you want to lock in your proﬁts and sell at that time. There probably will be many others in a similar position who also will want to sell when the price again approaches those recent highs (the area labeled “Resistance 2”). This creates a natural barrier at that price because many traders will want to sell at what they consider a high Falling Off the Edge • 79 price. Since the previous highs set in early August become the anchor against which subsequent prices are measured, prices that approach that price are considered high. Therefore, more and more traders are willing to sell as the price approaches those highs. Finding the Edge in Support and Resistance Like many aspects of trading, the concept of support and resistance is a loose construct rather than a hard-and-fast rule
