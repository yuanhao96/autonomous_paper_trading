Section 28). It occurs when prices reach a new high but the indicator reaches a lower high than it did on a previous rally. Bearish divergences mark the best shorting opportunities. When the trend is down, bears feel like good children, praised and 62 MASS PSYCHOLOGY As long as bears feel like winners, they continue to sell at lower prices, and the downtrend continues. It ends when bears start feeling cautious and refuse to sell at lower prices. Rallies and Declines Few traders act as purely rational human beings. There is a great deal of emotional activity in the markets. Most market participants act on the principle of "monkey see, monkey do." The waves of fear and greed sweep up bulls and bears. Markets rise because of greed among buyers and fear among short sellers. Bulls normally like to buy on the cheap. When they turn very bullish, they become more concerned with not missing the rally than with getting a cheap price. A rally continues as long as bulls are greedy enough to meet sellers' demands. The sharpness of a rally depends on how traders feel. If buyers feel just a little stronger than sellers, the market rises slowly. When they feel much stronger than sellers, the market rises fast.

Markets fall because of greed among bears and fear among bulls. Normally bears prefer to sell short on rallies, but if they expect to make a lot of money on a decline, they don't mind shorting on the way down. Fearful buyers agree to buy only below the market. As long as short sellers are willing to meet those demands and sell at a bid, the decline continues. As bulls' profits melt and turn into losses, they panic and sell at almost any price. They are so eager to get out that they hit the bids under the market. Markets can fall very fast when hit by panic selling. Trend Leaders Loyalty is the glue that holds groups together. Freud showed that group members relate to their leader the way children relate to a father. Group 16. PSYCHOLOGY OF TRENDS 63 members expect leaders to inspire and reward them when they are good but to punish them when they are bad. Who leads market trends? When individuals try to control a market, they usually end up badly. For example, the bull market in silver in the 1980s was led by the Hunt brothers of Texas and their Arab associates. The Hunts ended up in a bankruptcy court. They had no money left even for a limousine and had to ride the s u b w y to the courthouse. Market gurus sometimes lead trends, but they never last beyond one market cycle (see
