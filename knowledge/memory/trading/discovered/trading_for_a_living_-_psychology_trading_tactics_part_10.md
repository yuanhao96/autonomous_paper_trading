Section 28). It occurs when prices reach a new high but the indicator reaches a lower high than it did on a previous rally. Bearish divergences mark the best shorting opportunities. When the trend is down, bears feel like good children, praised and 64 MASS PSYCHOLOGY rewarded for being smart. They feel increasingly confident, add to their positions, and the downtrend continues. New bears come into the market. Most people admire winners, and the financial media keep interviewing bears in bear markets. Bulls lose money in downtrends, and that makes them feel bad. Bulls dump their positions, and many switch sides to join bears. Their selling pushes markets lower. After a while, bears grow confident and bulls feel demoralized. Suddenly, a price shock occurs. A cluster of buy orders soaks up all available sell orders and lifts the market. Now bears feel like children whose father has lashed out at them in the midst of a happy meal. A price shock plants the seeds of a downtrend's eventual reversal because bears become more fearful and bulls grow bolder. When a child begins to doubt that Santa Claus exists, he seldom believes in Santa again. Even if bears recover and prices fall to a new low, several technical indicators identify their weakness by tracing a pattern called a bullish divergence. It occurs when prices fall to a new low but an indicator traces a more shallow bottom than during the previous decline. Bullish divergences identify the best buying opportunities. Social Psychology An individual has a free will and his behavior is hard to predict. Group behavior is more primitive and easier to follow. When you analyze markets, you analyze group behavior. You need to identify the direction in which groups run and their changes. Groups suck us in and cloud our judgment. The problem for most analysts is that they get caught in the mentality of the groups they analyze. The longer a rally continues, the more technicians get caught up in bullish sentiment, ignore the danger signs, and miss the reversal. The longer a decline goes on, the more technicians get caught up in bearish gloom and ignore bullish signs. This is why it helps to have a written plan for analyzing the markets. We have to decide in advance what indicators we will watch and how we will interpret them. Floor traders use several tools for tracking the quality and intensity of a crowd's feelings. They watch the crowd's ability to break through recent support and resistance levels. They keep an eye on the flow of "paper"- customer orders that come to the floor in response to price changes. Floor 17. MANAGING VERSUS FORECASTING 65 traders listen to the changes in pitch and volume of the roar on the exchange floor. If you trade away from the floor, you need other tools for analyzing crowd behavior. Your charts and indicators reflect mass psychology in action. A technical analyst is an applied social psychologist, often armed with a computer. 17. MANAGING VERSUS FORECASTING I once ran into a very fat surgeon at a seminar. He told me that he had lost a quarter of a million dollars in three years trading stocks and options. When I asked him how he made his trading decisions, he sheepishly pointed to his ample gut. He gambled on hunches and used his professional income to support his habit. There are two alternatives to "gut feel": One is fundamental analysis; the other is technical analysis. Major bull and bear markets result from fundamental changes in supply and demand. Fundamental analysts follow crop reports, study the actions of the Federal Reserve, track industry utilization rates, and so on. Even if you know those factors, you can lose money trading if you are out of touch with intermediate- and short-term trends. They depend on the crowd's emotions. Technical analysts believe that prices reflect everything known about the market, including all fundamental factors. Each price represents the consensus of value of all market participants - large commercial interests and small speculators, fundamental researchers, technicians, and gamblers. Technical analysis is a study of mass psychology. It is partly a science and partly an art. Technicians use many scientific methods, including mathematical concepts of game theory, probabilities, and so on. Many technicians use computers to track sophisticated indicators. Technical analysis is also an art. The bars on a chart coalesce into patterns and formations. When prices and indicators move, they produce a sense of flow and rhythm, a feeling of tension and beauty that helps you sense what is happening and how to trade. Individual behavior is complex, diverse, and difficult to predict. Group behavior is primitive. Technicians study the behavior patterns of market crowds. They trade when they recognize a pattern that preceded past market moves. , MASS PSYCHOLOGY Poll-Taking Political poll-taking is a good model of technical analysis. Technicians and polltakers try to read the mass mind. Polltakers do it for political gain, technicians for financial gain. Politicians want to know their chances of being elected or re-elected. They make promises to constituents and then ask polltakers about their odds of winning. Polltakers use scientific methods: statistics, sampling procedures, and so on. They also need a flair for interviewing and phrasing questions; they have to be plugged into the emotional undercurrents of their party. Poll-taking is a combination of science and art. If a polltaker says he is a scientist, ask him why every major political polltaker in the United States is affiliated with either the Democratic or Republican party. True science knows no party. A market technician must rise above party affiliation. Be neither a bull nor a bear, but only seek the truth. A biased bull looks at a chart and says, "Where can I buy?" A biased bear looks at the same chart and tries to find where he can go short. A top-flight analyst is free of bullish or bearish bias. There is a trick to help you det
