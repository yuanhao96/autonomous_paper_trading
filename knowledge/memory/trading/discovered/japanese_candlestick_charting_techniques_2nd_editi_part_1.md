Chapter 1. There are others whom I would like to thank for their help in lighting my path. There were so many who contributed to this project that if I have forgotten to mention anyone I apologize for this oversight. Vll vm Acknowledgments The underpinnings for all my research on candles are the translations provided by Richard Solberg. His acquisitions of the Japanese candle charting books, his ideas, and his work provided the scaffolding for the rest of my candle endeavors. The Market Technicians Association (MTA) deserves special mention. It was at the MTA's library that I first discovered candle material written in English. This material, albeit scant, was extremely difficult to obtain, but the marvelously complete MTA library had it. Yoji Inata spent many hours answering my more advanced questions. He was also kind enough to contact his peers in Japan to get more detailed answers if necessary. The Nippon Technical Analysts Association ( NTAA ) deserves utmost praise for their assistance. Mr. Kojiiro Watanabe helped me to contact NTAA members who have been especially helpful. They are: Mr. Minoru Eda and Mr. Yasushi Hayashi Nori Hayashi. There are many candle charting software programs available. For this book I used two of what I consider the best: Aspen Graphics (www.Aspenres.com ) and CQG (www.cqg.com ). Their products and support are top-notch. Just as I did in the first edition, I again want to thank "idea a day" Bruce Kamich. Bruce is a friend and a fellow technician with over 25 years' experience. He continues to provide many valuable ideas and suggestions. Mark Tunkel, a friend and a colleague for many years, has powerful insights into candle charts. His help on this book is much appreciated. Susan Barry, the editor for the first edition of this book, had the foresight to convince her boss that candles would be popular enough to take a chance on a book. The increasing sales since its initial publication in 1991 have confirmed her thinking. For this edition, Ellen Schneid Coleman and Sybil Grace at Prentice Hall have taken the coal of this book and made it into a diamond. Of course, there is my family. It's hard to believe that my son was just born when I wrote the first edition. (He's now 11.) I told him that I came close to calling him Candlesticks Nison. That name would be appropriate. Evan's a very quick learner especially when it comes to finances—and can't absorb candle charting fast enough. I think we will put our family finances in his hands. — Acknowledgments Rebecca, four years old when the first edition was published, is a very bright young lady now. She makes me proud to be her father. If we put our finances in her hands, we would be homeless, but would have lots of clothing and make-up. My wife Bonnie continues to be our cornerstone. Without her, everything would fall apart and there would be no way this book could have been done.
