and Shoulders Formation and the many variations of its basic construction. His first description centers on its idealized construction (as is the case when initially describing patterns and formations to be seen on the charts. That they have to be “generally” described can be taken for granted, as any description is normally started with an idealized version first. However, this must of necessity be tempered with the student’s realization that as in nature, so is it in the reality of any patterned price movement, nothing repeats itself “exactly.”) Following this introduction to the price formation or action that he is presenting as he typically does throughout the Course, he presents those factors that can be confidently relied on, and gives equal attention to the blemishes, the weaknesses, and numerous things that can upset the best of analytical forecasts. Certainly the thinking here was not to make analysis difficult (it always is anyway), but really to prepare the student’s analytical thinking to see that price is always moving into the unknown as is its nature, challenging the student’s mind to be more acutely tuned into looking at other important things that can also give clues to the resultant move out of the pattern that has been noted. One of the most important things that the author especially stresses is the paying of close attention to the Volume factor (too often ignored even by experienced technical analysts, as it is admittedly very difficult to get a handle on) as to whether it is increasing, decreasing, or standing still in relation to the rising and falling price movements at the time. In keeping with his instructive pattern descriptions of the Head and Shoulders, Schabacker similarly covers the other Reversal Formations to be found described in the text, the Rounding Turn, the Symmetrical, Right-angle, Descending, Ascending, and Inverted Triangles, Broadening Tops, Diamond Formations, Rectangles, Island Reversals, and the others. Lest it might be thought that all these pattern descriptions are straightforward there is no lack of attention paid to the possibly troublesome deviation details in the appearance of each formation’s structure. Following the descriptive details in the chapters on the Reversal Formations, the next series of patterns demanding attention are the Continuation Formations. When they live up to their name, which is fairly often, these portray resting places along the trend where they gather strength to continue upwards or downwards as the prior trend dictates if it remains intact. They are generally also very recognizable, for in the patterns found in this group their names are closely related to their shapes like the Flag, the Pennant, the Rectangle, and again various shapes of Triangles. Since – xv – EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION Continuation Formations occasionally turn into Reversal Formations, they can at times be the bane of the chart analyst; however, in any action in the marketplace at any time, the market is
