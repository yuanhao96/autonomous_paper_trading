Chapter 8 in this edition, “New Eras and Bubbles around the World,” details how many times we have had similar, if smaller or more localized, stock market booms and crashes. There was something relatively new then: the stock market boom that we now know peaked in early 2000 was worldwide in scope. In the first edition, I called it the Millennium Boom, because it came just before the dawn of the new millennium. We might also confidently call it the Millennium Bubble now, after it is over. But this boom or bubble was not really bigger in its collapse than its counterpart, which peaked in 1929. These really large bubbles are rare events, but the Millennium Bubble was not unique in history. In the second edition (2005), I made much of the fact that for the United States as a whole, the boom in home prices nationwide that had begun in the late 1990s was the biggest ever, or biggest at least since 1890, when my data began. But, at the same time, the new chapter that was added to that edition also recounted earlier housing bubbles, and, if you look at centuries past, land price bubbles. Centuries ago, real estate speculation would have been more likely an investment in land—a farm or a town lot for building a home. Another big change in the second half of the twentieth century was a massive decline in lending standards for home mortgages. That decline, and the magnitude of the housing boom around the world (which we might now, after the collapse of home prices in many areas after 2006, confidently call a bubble) was unique. We might call this the Ownership-Society Boom, associated as it was with a slogan used by George W. Bush in his 2004 U.S. presidential campaign to describe his plan to promote widespread ownership of homes, stocks, and other investments. (I will call the current stock market boom, from 2009 to the time of this writing in 2014, the New-Normal Boom, after a term popularized by Bill Gross [then of PIMCO] in 2009.) But there is really nothing new about these bubbles—not fundamentally new. They are repeats of approximately the same phenomenon, of new era PRE FA C E T O T H E TH IRD E D ITIO N xiii stories proliferating by word-of-mouth contagion, of the distinct feel of mass enthusiasm for one kind of investment. Improving information technology may accelerate their dynamics. Changing patterns of investing are also a factor. The rising impact of international investors and of institutional investors in single-family homes has been much noted in recent years. But the basic bubble phenomenon is the same. In the future, we will surely have even bigger such bubbles, each built up around its new and different new era story, and we will have to invent new names for them. I was not expecting to hear about housing bubbles when I visited Colombia in mid-2013. Yet over and over again I heard about their amazing real estate boom. While taking me through the seaside resort town of Cartagena, my limousine driver pointed out a number of ordinary-looking homes that had recently sold for millions of U.S. dollars. The Banco de la República, Colombia’s central bank, has on their website a home price index for three major cities: Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali. The index shows home price increases of 69% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2004. That rate of price growth recalls the U.S. experience, with the S&P/ Case-Shiller Ten-City Home Price Index for the United States rising 131% in real terms from its bottom in 1997 to its peak in 2006. The vulnerability we have to bubbles in Colombia and all over the world reveals our continuing lack of understanding of these phenomena. Just what is a speculative bubble? The Oxford English Dictionary defines a bubble as “anything fragile, unsubstantial, empty, or worthless; a deceptive show. From 17th c. onwards often applied to delusive commercial or financial schemes.” The problem is that words like show and scheme suggest a deliberate creation, rather than a widespread social phenomenon that is not directed by any central impresario. Maybe the word bubble is used too carelessly. Eugene Fama certainly thinks so. Fama, the most important proponent of the “efficient markets hypothesis,” denies that speculative bubbles exist. In his 2014 Nobel lecture, Fama states that the word bubble refers to “an irrational strong price increase that implies a predictable strong decline.”3 If that is what bubble means, and if predictable means that we can specify the date when a bubble bursts, then I agree with him that there may be little solid evidence that bubbles exist. But that is not my definition of a bubble, for speculative markets are just not so predictable. In the second edition of this book, I tried to give a better definition of a bubble that accords with more enlightened usage of that term. The definition, given in
