If a trader combines Japanese Candles with Ichimoku Kinko Byo, a powerful system is available to him or her. In fact, it increases the probability of trading drastically and can be evidenced by trading in a "paper" account after reading this book Japanese Candlesticks will not be discussed further in this book and any additional infomlation regarding this topic is avaiJable through Steve Nison's books and training seminars. By the time this book is published, the market will be one that has not been experienced previously; not even historical traders can predict what the future holds.

Technology be­ gan to advance drastically in a short period. The size of a microchip was getting smaller and smaller and the computing power within the microchip was exponentially i.ncreasi.ng in a short amount of time. What normally took a room full of technological resources to do was now available in the size of a desktop computer. A perfect example of the rapid change in technology is mainframes.
