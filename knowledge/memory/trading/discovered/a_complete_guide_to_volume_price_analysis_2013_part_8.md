one direction, and with associated supporting volume, then this was the signal of the start of a trend. From this basic principle, Charles Dow then extended and developed this idea to the three principle stages of a trend. He defined the first stage of a bullish trend as, ‘the accumulation phase’, the starting point for any trend higher. He called the second stage ‘the public participation phase’ which could be considered the technical trend following stage. This was usually the longest of the three phases. Finally, he identified the third stage, which he called ‘the distribution phase’. This would typically see investors rushing into the market, terrified that they were missing out on a golden opportunity. Whilst the public were happily buying, what Charles Dow called ‘the smart money’, were doing the exact opposite, and selling. The smart money was taking its profits and selling to an increasingly eager public. And all of this buying and selling activity could all be seen through the prism of volume. Charles Dow himself, never published any formal works on his approach to trading and investing, preferring to publish his thoughts and ideas in the embryonic Wall Street Journal. It was only after his death in 1902, that his work was collated and published, first by close friend and colleague Sam Nelson, and later by William Hamilton. The book published in 1903, entitled The ABC of Stock Speculation was the first to use the term 'Dow Theory', a hook on which to hang the great man's ideas. Whilst volume was one of the central tenets of his approach to the market, and consequent validation of the associated price action, it was the development of the idea of trends, which was one of the driving principle for Charles Dow. The other was the concept of indices to give investors an alternative view of the fundamentals of market behaviour with which to validate price. This was the reason he developed the various indices such as the Dow Jones Transportation Index, to provide a benchmark against which ‘related industrial sectors’ could provide a view of the broader economy. After all, if the economy were strong, then this would be reflected in the performance of companies in different sectors of the market. An early exponent of cross market analysis if you like! If Charles Dow was the founding father of technical analysis, it was a contemporary of his, Richard Wyckoff, who could be considered to be the founding father of volume and price analysis, and who created the building blocks of the methodology that we use today. Wyckoff was a contemporary of Dow, and started work on Wall Street as a stock runner at the age of 15 in 1888, at much the same time as Dow was launching his first edition of the Wall Street Journal. By the time he was 25 he had made enough money from his trading to open his own brokerage office. Unusually, not with the primary goal of making more money for himself (which he did), but as an educator and source of unbiased information for the
