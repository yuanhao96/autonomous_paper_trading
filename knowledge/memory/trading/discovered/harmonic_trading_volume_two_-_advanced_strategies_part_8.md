Chapter 1 Contemporary Market Case Studies from a Harmonic Trading Perspective 13 entirely confirmed. After 13 years, was a major correction at hand? But, an entire meltdown of the preceding bull market still required a violation of many harmonic support levels before I would consider an official bear position. I found myself locked into a bullish mode until enough patterns failed that the information—like a brick being slammed over my head—was indicating significantly more downside than a minor correction. The predominance of the strong uptrend of the prior decades created an inherent bullish bias that favored trading these setups more than bearish patterns. Although the bearish patterns were still effective in determining excellent selling opportunities, the lasting bias of the prior bull market needed to be overcome. As more bullish patterns failed, the technical evidence mounted to respect the severity of the price action. Not to mention, the information provided by this analysis was accurately pinpointing that the overall market direction had changed to a bearish bias. The trend was clearly reversing and heading lower. The Importance of Pattern Violations The bear markets of 2000 and 2008 possessed critical long-term harmonic setups that clearly defined the most relevant technical levels within their overall respective trends. Critical longterm support levels and distinct harmonic patterns consistently marked important turning points and clearly signified the extent of the trouble at hand in each case. The recognition of such price action led to a greater understanding of the importance of these formations as significant technical signals. Within the context of the primary bearish trend, especially in 2000, the repeated pattern failures provided the evidence needed to effectively validate the state of the market. Also, this helped me to focus mostly on bearish patterns for my trading and favor the short side until the major market indices stabilized in both cases. I must emphasize the importance of this adjustment as a critical advancement in my thinking regarding the entire Harmonic Trading methodology. Instead of staying locked into a bullish mentality, I was able to reassess the current environment of the financial markets at this time and make the adjustments necessary to adapt to the changing environment. Regardless of whether a particular setup was valid, the price action at the completion of many harmonic patterns in the major U.S. indices provided accurate information regarding their future direction. If a pattern was a valid opportunity, the price action typically reversed at the completion point. However, price action that exceeded the completion point for a critical pattern normally resulted in a further extension of the primary trend. In the case of both markets in 2000 and 2008, the failure of long-term bullish patterns led to a substantial downside continuation. “A Signpost for Future Price Action” Another result of these bear markets was a reinforcement of the fact that a pattern is more a signpost of potential future action and not an “end all, be all” signal for trading. I have discussed this principle in each of my three books. In fact, in The Harmonic Trader, I discussed this concept as a critical first step to enable an unbiased perspective and not get locked into one side of the market or the other. Throughout early 2000, a problem quickly emerged when many 14 Harmonic Trading: Volume Two of the people who initially embraced the Harmonic Trading concepts became disparaged as the bear market progressed. In fact, I received e-mails from people who claimed that harmonic price patterns no longer worked. The problem was not the failure of harmonic patterns, rather their interpretation and analysis of the technical information provided by such failures was flawed. Instead of getting locked in to this mentality, I realized that the overwhelming pattern failures of the time were indicating a further substantial decline in the financial markets. Furthermore, the bullish pattern violations were in fact frequently providing clear trading opportunities, as each breakdown in price action below the projected harmonic support area typically accelerated after failing the setup. In this manner, particular patterns did serve to pinpoint the continuation areas of the major reversal at hand, time and time again. At a minimum, the price levels determined by Harmonic Trading measurement techniques were consistently identifying the key areas within the primary trend to examine for clues of potential future price action. Distinct long-term Potential Reversal Zones (PRZ) were defining the make-or-break support and resistance levels. Furthermore, the effectiveness of long-term harmonic ratios to gauge price action was particularly impressive. Regardless of the type of setup, the effectiveness of this methodology was consistently accurate in pinpointing the most critical technical levels throughout these volatile times. The Proving Grounds—A Comprehensive Test From a longer-term perspective, the experience of these reports of the prior decade resulted in a definitive substantiation of the Harmonic Trading techniques as an effective technical approach to analyze price action. As I mentioned previously, the rules within the Harmonic Trading methodology were relatively new at this time. My ability to navigate through the difficult trading environment during that period was put to the test. In the end, I believe that my overall advisory record and detailed reports prove that Harmonic Trading techniques passed the test and substantiated the validity of this approach. I say this because these reports represent one of the most accurate long-term case studies that have been compiled for this approach. In each of these markets, I correctly determined the major market trend changes of the time and identified the critical long-term price levels in each instance. The ability to accurately quantify cr
