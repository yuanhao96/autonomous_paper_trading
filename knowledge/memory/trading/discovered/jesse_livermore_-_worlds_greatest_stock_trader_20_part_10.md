someone to call on the phone and threaten. He reread the headline of the interview he had given that appeared in the October 22, 1929 edition of the Times: “Livermore Not in Bear Pool.” He read on: Jesse L. Livermore, who has been widely reported in Wall Street to have been heavily short of the market on the present break, and to be the leader of a bear pool, denied yesterday any connection with such a pool. Mr. Livermore’s statement, issued from his offices at 730 Fifth Avenue, follows: “In connection with the various reports, which have been industriously spread during the last few days through the newspapers and various brokerage houses, to the effect that a large bear pool has been formed, headed by myself and 8467_Smitten_01_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:38 PM Page 12 • 12 • JESSE LIVERMORE : WORLD ’ S GREATEST STOCK TRADER financed by various well known capitalists; I wish to state that there is no truth whatever in any such rumors as far as I’m concerned, and I know of no such combination having been formed by others. “What little business I do in the stock market has only been as an individual and will continue to be done on such a basis. “It is very foolish to think that any individual or combination of individuals could artificially bring about a decline in the stock market in a country so large and so prosperous as the United States.
