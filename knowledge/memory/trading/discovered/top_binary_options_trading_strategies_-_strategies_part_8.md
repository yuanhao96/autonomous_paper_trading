Unlike most other brokers they have their own proprietary trading platform that is built woth ease-of-use in mind. Many rival brokers have been trying to emulate their platform. EZTrader has had some issues, but after they have been acquired by Win Global Markets (WGM) Services Ltd in early 2011 the company has had remarkable improvements in the level of its services. EZTrader is great for beginners, but it lacks advanced charting features and different expiry dates if you are looking for something more than basics. A unique feature that we loved is the “profit locking” which allows traders to sell their positions before expiry to lock in profits. Of course this service comes at a premium as traders either have to sacrifice some profits via a reduction in expected percentage return or pay some money to close out early losses. Pros • Very beginner-friendly platform • Big bonuses up to 52% • Unique proﬁt locking feature lets you sell the winning position before the expiry • Apps not only for Android and iPhone, but also for tablets • 24/7 support Cons • Only high/low trading options • Limited extra features, like chart options etc. • No demo account Visit broker Facts • Founded in 2008 • Regulators: CySec* • Minimum deposit: $200 • Minimum trade: $25 • Assets to trade: 107 • Withdrawal methods: Credit/Debit card (free), Wire transfer (€15 processing fee) DETAILED REVIEW Released in the spring of 2013, Redwood binary Options has already proved itself in the binary options industry.
