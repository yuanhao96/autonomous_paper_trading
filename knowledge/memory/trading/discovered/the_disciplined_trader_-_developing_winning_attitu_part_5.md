PART II The Nature of the Trading Environment from a Psychological Perspective 37 In Chapters 1 and 2 the material presented outlined some of the difficulties of trading. In the next six chapters, I will get much more specific by explaining the characteristics of the market environment from the psychological perspective of the individual trader. From this perspective it will become clear to you how the market environment is much different from the cultural environment you learned to function within. This will confront you with some very unusual psychological challenges. My primary objective is for you to understand clearly why any degree of success as a trader is so elusive, attained by so few, and why you may need to change some deeply ingrained cultural attitudes and beliefs to function successfully in the trading environment. 38
