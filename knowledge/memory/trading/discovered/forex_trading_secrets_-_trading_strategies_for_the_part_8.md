CHAPTER 1 WHAT YOU MUST KNOW TO GET STARTED 7 FOREX VERSUS STOCKS What are the differences between trading in the FOREX and operating in the stock market? The FOREX market is always open. Like some supermarkets that are open 24 hours, the FOREX is a “supermarket” of currencies, open 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. The FOREX opens in most of the brokers on Sunday at 3 to 5 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) and stays open until Friday at 4 p.m. EST (it must be borne in mind that the opening and closing—Sunday and Friday—may vary from broker to broker). In this way, traders have the ability to operate either in the American, Asian, or European markets, which gives them the advantage of being able to react to certain events or news that is bound to emerge and also gives them the opportunity to decide their schedules. No commission is charged. Most brokers do not charge additional fees or commissions to buy or sell currencies, whether online or by telephone. This is so because of the use of a fixed spread that is consistent and transparent. The cost of a buy/sell in the FOREX market is much lower than in any other market (e.g., stock, futures, etc.). A side note to this is that because of the competition for narrower spreads and faster executions, some brokers are providing very tight spreads and extremely fast execution with little latency. In order for them to do this, however, they are now starting to charge commissions. The commissions vary, and with a little due diligence, you will be able to find just the right broker. Orders are executed instantly. In normal market conditions, the execution of orders at a given price is done instantly. The trader places the order at the quoted price, which is being updated in real time. There is no difference between the price shown by the broker and the price at which the purchase order is executed. There are special conditions, though, in which market volatility is such that orders can be delayed or requoted, but under normal conditions, there are no such delays. There are no restrictions on short selling. Unlike the stock market, the FOREX has no restrictions to open sell positions (short). In the FOREX, there is a chance to buy or sell regardless of whether the market is bullish or bearish. Owing to the fact that in the FOREX there is always someone buying a currency and selling another at FOREX TRADING SECRETS 8 the same time, there is no structural bias in the market. A trader can operate both upward and downward in the market. What, then, is the relationship between the stock market and the FOREX? The stock market serves as a key indicator for the FOREX market. Technology has facilitated the possibility of investing in markets other than the local market/country, no matter their geographic location. Therefore, it has forged a relationship between the stock market and the currency of the country like this: If the stock market is going upward, it increases the investment in dollars, but in a market that is on the downside, investors tend to sell shares of companies in that country, attempting to recover capital and investing in another country. Here’s a table showing the main advantages of the FOREX versus stocks: Advantage FOREX Stocks 24-Hour market No commissions Instant execution Short selling Yes Yes* Yes Yes No No No No *Some exceptions. There are no intermediaries. Stock markets that tend to be centralized have advantages for the operator. But a problem with this is the need for an intermediary between the stock market and the trader. However, FOREX intermediaries do not exist, and thus the trader may buy or sell in the FOREX market without physical intermediaries that can buy or sell a particular pair at the time that they wish or think is appropriate. In the absence of an intermediary, the trader gets higher profits at lower costs. The market is not controlled for buys or sells. The stock market is more susceptible to speculation based primarily on rumors of buying or selling by other companies. I can see this when a big company buys another relatively smaller company, and the value of the company’s shares increase. But the stock market is also likely to go down when you think that a company has been making profits and that investors tend to take profits by selling the shares. The analysts and firms are less influenced. The stock market is more influenced by rumors of one company being bought by another. This is why sometimes the firms or analysts can recommend a
