Section 9, “Risk Management”). 6. Be aware that a trader is the weakest link in any trading system. Go to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous to learn how to avoid losses or develop your own method for cutting out impulsive trades. 7. Winners think, feel, and act differently than losers. You must look within yourself, strip away your illusions, and change your old ways of being, thinking, and acting. Change is hard, but if you want to be a professional trader, you have to work on changing and developing your personality. In order to succeed, you need drive, knowledge, and discipline. Money is important, but less so than any of those qualities. If you have enough drive to work through this book, you’ll acquire much knowledge, and then we’ll close the circle by returning to the topic of discipline in the final chapters.

The farming legacy lives on in the language of traders. Four animals are mentioned especially often on Wall Street: bulls and bears, hogs and sheep. Traders say: “Bulls make money, bears make money, but hogs get slaughtered.” A bull fights by striking up with his horns. A bull is a buyer—a person who bets on a rally and profits from a rise in prices. A bear fights by striking down with his paws. A bear is a seller—a person who bets on a decline and profits from a fall in prices.1 Hogs are greedy. Some of them buy or sell positions that are too large for their accounts and get slaughtered by a small adverse move. Other hogs overstay their positions—they keep waiting for profits even after the trend reverses. Sheep are passive and fearful followers of trends, tips, and gurus. They sometimes put on a bull’s horns or a bearskin and try to swagger. You can recognize them by their pitiful bleating when the market becomes volatile. Whenever the market is open, bulls are buying, bears are selling, hogs and sheep get trampled underfoot, and the undecided traders wait on the sidelines. Quote screens around the world show a steady stream of the latest prices for any trading vehicle. Thousands of eyes are focused on each price as people make trading decisions. 1 There is plenty of room in the market for both, and occasionally even at the same time. It always amuses me in SpikeTrade when two elite traders pick the same stock—one long and the other short. Often by the end of the week both are profitable, proving that how you manage your trade is more important than what stock and direction you pick. 31 32 MASS PSYCHOLOGY ■■11. What Is Price? Traders can be divided into three groups: buyers, sellers, and undecided. Buyers want to pay as little as possible, and sellers want to charge as much as possible. Their permanent conflict is reflected in bid-ask spreads, discussed in the Introduction. “Ask” is what a seller asks for his merchandise. “Bid” is what a buyer offers for that merchandise. A buyer has a choice: to wait until prices come down or pay what the sellers demand. A seller has a similar choice: wait until prices rise or accept a lower offer for his merchandise. A trade occurs when there is a momentary meeting of two minds: an eager bull agrees to a seller’s terms and pays up, or an eager bear agrees to a buyer’s terms and sells a little cheaper. The presence of undecided traders puts pressure on bulls and bears. Buyers and sellers move fast because they know that they’re surrounded by a crowd of undecided traders who may step in and snatch away their deal at any moment. The buyer knows that if he thinks too long, another trader can step in and buy ahead of him. A seller knows that if he tries to hold out for a higher price, another trader may step in and sell at a lower price. The crowd of undecided traders makes buyers and sellers more willing to deal with their opponents. A trade occurs when there is a meeting of two minds. A Consensus of â•›Value Each tick on your quote screen represents a deal between a buyer and a seller. Buyers are buying because they expect prices to rise. Sellers are selling because they expect prices to fall. Buyers and sellers are surrounded by crowds of undecided traders who put pressure on them because they may become buyers or sellers themselves. Buying by bulls pushes markets up, selling by bears pushes them down, and undecided traders make everything happen faster by creating a sense of urgency among buyers and sellers. Traders come to the markets from all over the world: in person, via computers, or through their brokers. Everybody has a chance to buy and to sell. Each price is a momentary consensus of value of all market participants, expressed in action. Prices are created by masses of traders—buyers, sellers, and undecided people. The patterns of prices and volume reflect mass psychology of the markets. Behavior Patterns Huge crowds trade on stock, commodity, and option exchanges. Big money and little money, smart money and dumb money, institutional money and private money, long-term investors and short-term traders, all meet at the exchange.

WHAT IS THE MARKET? 33 traders at the moment of transaction. There is a crowd of traders behind every pattern on the screen. Crowd consensus changes from moment to moment. Sometimes it gets established in a very low-key environment, and at other times the environment turns wild. Prices move in small increments during quiet times. When a crowd becomes either spooked or elated, prices begin to jump. Imagine bidding for a life preserver aboard a sinking ship—that’s how prices leap when masses of traders become emotional about a trend. An astute trader aims to enter the market during quiet times and take profits during wild times. That, of course, is th
