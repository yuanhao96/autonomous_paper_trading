Chapter 28 on their bottom siblings, then horn tops should come as no surprise. A horn top is an inverted version of the weekly horn bottom. A horn top sports twin peaks separated by a week and is commonly found near the end of an uptrend. Volume is usually heavy at both peaks but not by a huge margin above Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (Semiconductor, NYSE, AMD) Double Top – 34 Horn – 32 – 30 – 28 – 26 – 24 – 22 – 20 – 18 – 16 – 14 – 12 – 10 – 8 – 6 – 4 – 2 92 J A S O N D 93 F M A M J J A S O N D 94 F – 0 M Figure 29.1 Horn top showing twin peaks. The stock drops almost in half after the horn top. Note the weekly time scale. The two peaks in April and August represent a double top. 4366_29.qxd 2/23/05 12:03 PM Page 453 Identification Guidelines 453 the 25-day moving average. After the right price spike, prices drop lower and continue moving down, sometimes substantially. In Figure 29.1 the stock begins its rise to the horn in mid-June 1993 at a price of 20.38. At the peak, prices reach a high of 32.63, a gain of 60% in 2 months. With such a sharp gain in so little time, a consolidation or congestion region is likely. Instead, the horn top marks a change in trend. Combined with the earlier top, the double top is a bearish signal. After the twin peaks of the horn appear, prices drop to 26, then pull back to the formation base, generally following an up-sloping trend line. Then prices head down again. In the beginning of January, prices reach bottom at 16.75 for a decline of almost 50%. Identification Guidelines Table 29.1 shows identification characteristics that make horn tops easy to recognize. Consider the horn shown in Figure 29.2. Weekly chart, upward spikes. Use the weekly chart to facilitate identification. Look for twin price spikes that are separated by a week. Clear visibility. The two spikes should be well above the surrounding prices (clear visibility) and a good distance from the high in the center week. If you look back over the price history for the year, the two spikes should stand out and be larger than most other spikes. In Figure 29.2, you can see that the price spike in late September is the only real competition (for the period shown, anyway). The high-to-high price variation between the two spikes is usually small, but need not be. Confirmation. Confirmation occurs when price closes below the lowest low in the chart pattern. Only when that happens does the 3-week pattern become a valid horn top. Do not trade a horn top without confirmation as price is likely to continue rising. Table 29.1 Identification Characteristics Characteristic Discussion Weekly chart, upward spikes Use the weekly chart and locate two upward price spikes separated by a week. The two spikes should be longer than similar spikes over the prior year and tower above the high of the center week. It should look like a horn. Clear visibility The horn highs should be well above the surrounding highs and the best performing reversals appear at the end of a long uptrend. Confirmation The pattern becomes a valid horn top when price closes below the lowest low in the pattern. Do not trade without confirmation. 4366_29.qxd 2/23/05 454 12:03 PM Page 454 Horn Tops Homestake Mining (Gold/Silver Mining, NYSE, HM) – 26 Horn – 25 – 24 – 23 – 22 Prior Price Spike – 21 – 20 – 19 – 18 – 17 – 16 – 15 – 14 – 13 93 O N D 94 F M A M J J A S O N D 95 F M Figure 29.2 Horn tops with unusually tall price spikes. This horn exceeds the clearance of an earlier spike. Focus on Failures There are a variety of reasons why a particular formation fails. Some break out upward and never look back, whereas others begin moving down, falter, and then recover and climb significantly. The latter case, the so-called 5% failures, are predominant with horn tops. Prices fail to continue down by more than 5% before recovering and heading higher. However, 5% failures are rare. What can be learned from examining the failures? Most horns warn about a coming decline by forming less than 2 months ahead of schedule. That finding is worth knowing. If a horn fails to call the turn in a stock you own, be alert to a possible trend change coming soon. You can improve your investment performance if you consider the overall environment for the stock. Look at the horn top pictured in Figure 29.3. After trending down for a year, the stock pierced the down-sloping trend line, signaling a trend change, and moved higher. Then the horn top formed. In situations like this, after a long downtrend, a stock usually bounces up, curls around, and retests the low (but not always). So when the horn formed, it probably signaled the price top before the retest. Although not shown in Figure 29.3, the stock did move lower, but it first bobbled up for a few months (to 63.50). Ultimately, the stock dipped to 49.13 before recovering. Before you invest in this formation, you have to place emphasis on the piercing of the down trend line. It suggests that prices will rise (a piercing is one indicator of a trend change). With a price rise imminent, why would you 4366_29.qxd 2/23/05 12:03 PM Page 455 455 Statistics Bandag Inc.

It is probably best to ignore such horn tops. A pipe bottom marks the turning point. consider shorting the stock? Even though the horn reversal suggests prices will decline (and they do, in the short term, but only by a dollar or so), does it merit a trade? When there is serious conflict or doubt about a situation, then look elsewhere for a more promising trade. Sure, you might miss making a killing now and again, but you do not want to end up on death row after your trading capital runs out from all the losses you have been taking.
