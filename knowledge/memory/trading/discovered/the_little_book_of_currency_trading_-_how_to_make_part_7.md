Chapter 9. In order to maintain the utmost efficiency, I spend time in the evenings listing the events that I plan to trade the next day. Since I trade during the New York session, I usually trade U.S. and Canadian economic reports that are released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time or 10:00 a.m. data. Occasionally I have the opportunity to trade 7:00 a.m. Canadian employment data or the Australian and New Zealand economic reports that are released toward the end of my day. Regardless of whether I take these trades, I create my trading plan the previous day, listing the currency that I plan to trade. Sometimes I also have an opinion on how the data could surprise and open a small position 20 minutes before the number is released and add to it once the data is out. Here’s a sample of my initial Daily Trading Plan (read on and you will see how it changes): Economic Data to Trade U.S. Trade Balance @ 8:30 a.m. Confidence: HIGH Bearish USD (because of decline in ISM) CAD Trade Balance @ 8:30 a.m. Confidence: MEDIUM Bearish CAD (because of decline in IVEY) Australian Employment @ 9:30 p.m. Confidence: HIGH Bullish AUD (employment component of PMIs increased) I also trade a few other short-term strategies that are a bit more complex and explained in further detail in my book for intermediate traders titled Day Trading and Swing Trading the Currency Market. One of my favorites is called the Momo, which is another momentum-based strategy. So the next thing that I do is list the currency pairs that could be setting up for the Momo and the levels to watch. Momo Setup in the Works EUR/USD: on break above 1.3245 GBP/USD: on break above 1.5825 USD/JPY: on break below 88.20 I am up early so all of this preparatory work is done before 8 a.m. Eastern Time! On this particular day, I am looking to short USD/JPY at 8:10 a.m. Eastern Time if the currency pair is trading below the 50-period SMA on the 5minute chart at that time and only add to the position if the U.S. trade balance is weak. If it is strong, I would close out my USD/JPY short trade immediately and move into a new long USD/JPY trade five minutes after the release if the move takes the currency pair above the 50-period SMA as explained in
