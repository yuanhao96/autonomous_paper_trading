Part III-A Little Bit of Everything 138 James B. Rogers, Jr.-Buying Value and Selling Hysteria Jim Rogers began trading the stock market with a paltry $600 in 1968. In 1973, he formed the Quantum Fund with partner George Soros. The Quantum Fund proved to be one of the bestperforming hedge funds, and in 1980, having amassed a small fortune, Rogers retired. "Retired" is the word Rogers uses to describe the management of his personal portfolio, an endeavor that requires considerable ongoing research. His retirement also includes teaching investment courses at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. I was eager to interview Rogers because of his stellar reputation as one of the shrewdest investors of our time and because his comments on television financial interview shows and in the print media always seemed to strike a note of common sense with rare clarity. Since I did not know Rogers, I sent him a letter requesting an interview, explaining that I was working on a book on great traders. I included a copy of my previous book on the futures markets, which I inscribed with a quotation from Voltaire that I deemed particularly appropriate: "Common sense is not so common." Rogers called a few days later to thank me for the book and to indicate his willingness to participate. "However," he cautioned, "I am probably not the person you want to interview. I often hold positions for many years. Furthermore, I'm probably one of the world's worst traders. I never get in at the right time." He was referring to the distinction I had made in my letter, indicating that I was interested in great traders rather than great investors. As I use the term, a "trader" would be primarily concerned with which direction the stock market was heading, while an "investor" would concentrate on selecting stocks with the best chance of outperforming the market overall. In other words, the investor was always long, while the trader might be long or short. I explained my use of these terms to Rogers and stressed that he was indeed the type of person I wished to interview. I arrived at Rogers' home, a baronial, eclectically furnished townhouse, on a fall-like spring afternoon. The atmosphere seemed more reminiscent of a comfortable English manor than a home in New York City. In fact, if my only exposure to New York City was that afternoon's conversation with Rogers in his antique-filled sitting room, with its pleasant views of the Hudson, I would conclude that New York City was an eminently peaceful place to live. After greeting me, Rogers immediately stated, "I still think you have the wrong man." Once again, he was referring to the fact that he did not consider himself to be a trader. This is the note on which the following interview begins. As I told you in our phone conversation, I don't consider myself a trader. I remember when I went to buy German stocks in 1982,1 said to the broker, "I want you to buy me X, Y, and Z stocks." The broker, who didn't know me, asked, "What do I do next?" I said, "You buy the stocks and send me the confirmations." He asked, "Do you want me to send you some research?" I said, "Please don't do that." He asked, "Do you want me to send you opinions?" I said, "No, no, don't." He asked, "Do you want me to call you with prices?" I said, "No, don't even give me prices, because if you do, once I see that these stocks have doubled and tripled, I might be tempted to sell them. I plan to own German stocks for at least three years, because I think you are about to have the biggest bull market you've had in two or three generations." Needless to say, the broker was dumbfounded; he thought I was a madman. Now I don't consider that trading; it was determining that there was about to be a major change in a market and taking a position. By the way, I got that one right. I bought the German stocks at the end of 1982 and sold them out in late 1985 and early 1986. What made you so bullish on Germany at that time? The bull market had started here in August 1982. More important, Germany had not had any kind of bull market since the previous all-time high in 1961, twenty-one years earlier. The German market had crumbled in 1962 and had essentially gone sideways since then. In the meantime, the German economy had boomed. So there was basic value there. Whenever I buy or sell something, I always try to make sure I'm not going to lose any money first. If there is very good value, then I'm probably not going to lose much money even if I'm wrong. 139 But you could have bought that market ten years earlier on the same theory. That's absolutely right. You could have bought it in 1971 for exactly those reasons and watched German stocks sit for ten years, while we had a major bull market in the U.S. But this time there was a catalyst. You always need a catalyst to make big things happen. At the time, the catalyst was the upcoming German elections. I figured the Socialists were going to be thrown out, and I knew that the opposition party, the Christian Democrats, had a platform designed to encourage investment. My basic assessment was that if the conservative Christian Democrats won the election after having been out of power for so many years, they were going to make major changes. I also knew that many German companies were holding back from investing in capital equipment and expansion in 1982 in anticipation of a conservative victory. Therefore, if the conservatives did win, there would be a real explosion of pent-up capital investment. Was the election a toss-up at the time? Not in my mind. I mean in terms of the polls. I guess so, because when the conservatives did win, the market exploded flmt same day. What if they had lost? I still didn't think I would have lost any meaningful money for the reasons I mentioned before. I had every anticipation that there was going to be a major change, and that the bull market would last for two, three, or four years. It sounds like you have a great deal of conviction w
