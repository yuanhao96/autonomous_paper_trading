Chapter 3 seeks to take this view a stage further and look at using order ﬂow — that is the sum of client ﬂows going through a bank — as a tool for forecasting and trading exchange rates. The tracking of capital ﬂows of necessity involves looking for apparent patterns in ﬂow movement. Linked in with this idea is the discipline of tracking patterns in price. This discipline is that of technical analysis. While the economic community appears to have ﬁnally taken the discipline of ﬂow analysis to its heart, there remains considerable resistance to any similar acceptance of technical analysis.
