Chapter 3, I will provide a unique visual glossary of candle patterns. This method of drawing the patterns will provide a dimension of candle pattern analysis that was 10 Candles never before available. After you explore with me the beauty and power of the candle charts, you will never be able to go back to a bar chart. This book will be a self-contained unit. I will not go over all the candle patterns; that is done in my first book. However, I will sometimes make referencesto the more obscureor rare patterns discussedin my first book. This is for the benefit of those who are familiar with all the candle patterns. Do not worry if you have not heard of the pattern before; it will not detract from the discussionof the chart. Numerous charts and exhibits will quickly and clearly make evident how candlescan enhanceyour trading, timing, and investing. As shown throughout the book, candles can be merged with any other form of technical analysis. Consequently, I have included charts that show how to fully utilize the candles' power alone, or when joined with other technical tools. Just as important as the recognition of candle patterns is an understanding of the relationship of the candle patterns to the overall technical picture.
