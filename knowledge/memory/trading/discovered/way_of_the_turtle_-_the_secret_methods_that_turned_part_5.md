Chapter 4. I also like to examine the individual monthly returns over time, as shown in Figure 7-5, which gives the monthly returns for the Donchian Trend system from 1996 to June 2006. I ﬁnd that a graph like the one in Figure 7-5 gives a pretty good indication of the relative pain versus reward one can expect and is much more revealing than a single ﬁgure or set of ﬁgures. Measuring Risk versus Reward There are several uniﬁed risk/reward measures that are used commonly to compare systems and trading managers who employ systems for their futures trading funds. The most common of these are the Sharpe ratio and the MAR ratio.

The Sharpe ratio was invented by the Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe in 1966 as a measure for comparing the performance of mutual funds. This measure was introduced as a reward-to-variability ratio but subsequently came to be referred to simply as the Sharpe ratio after its originator. The Sharpe ratio takes the differential return, which is the CAGR% for the period being measured (i.e., a monthly or yearly period subtracts what is known as the risk-free rate or the rate of interest one could get by investing in a risk-free bond such as a T-bill) and then divides it by the standard deviation of the returns being measured (generally monthly or yearly). Keep in mind that the Sharpe ratio was conceived as a measure for comparing the performance of mutual funds, not as a comprehensive risk/reward measure. Mutual funds are very speciﬁc types of investment vehicles that represent an unleveraged investment in a portfolio of stocks. The original role of the Sharpe ratio as a tool for comparing the performance of mutual funds gives important clues to the types of risks it does not contemplate. Mutual funds as they existed in 1966, when the Sharpe ratio ﬁrst was proposed, were unleveraged investments in portfolios of U.S. stocks. Thus, a comparison between mutual funds was one between investments in the same markets and with the same basic investment style. Further, at that time mutual funds held long-term investments in portfolios of stocks. Not having a signiﬁcant timing or trading component, they differed from each other only in their portfolio selection and diversiﬁcation strategies. So, for the special case of By What Measure? • 101 measuring mutual fund performance, the Sharpe ratio does a very good job of representing that risk because it correctly notes that for comparisons over the same period, the conﬁdence risk relates directly to the variance in the returns. All else being equal, a mutual fund with lower variance has less risk of having a return that deviates from the mean return it exhibited in the past. Although the Sharpe ratio is an excellent measure of risk/reward in comparing stock portfolio management strategies, it is not a sufﬁcient measure for comparing alternative investment funds such as futures and commodities hedge funds. The Sharpe ratio falls short here because alternative investment funds differ from unleveraged stock portfolios in several important areas that relate to risk: • Management style risk: Futures systems and funds often use short-term trading strategies that can differ greatly from the practices of traditional investment funds that use a buy and hold strategy. It is possible to lose money much more quickly with a trading strategy that involves frequent buying and selling. • Diversiﬁcation strategy risk: Many futures funds and trading systems do not offer the same level of internal diversiﬁcation that is found in traditional investments, having a much larger percentage of assets in a small number of instruments at any speciﬁc time. • Exposure: Futures have higher leverage than stocks, and this potentially exposes futures traders to more of the risk inherent in market ﬂuctuations. • Conﬁdence risk: Many futures fund managers do not have extensive track records. With a limited track record there is 102 • Way of the Turtle greater risk that an investor will see returns that fall short of expectations. Unfortunately, the use of the Sharpe ratio tends to exacerbate one of the problems I see in the industry, especially among those who do not understand trading and how it differs from traditional buy-and-hold investment in stocks: The focus on smoothness of returns as a proxy for risk. Let me be clear as possible here: Smoothness does not equal risk! Very risky investments can offer smooth returns for a limited period. Investors tend to believe that an investment or manager who has offered consistent positive returns over a period of several years is a safe investment. They hold this belief often without understanding how those returns actually are made. I believe that there is an inverse relationship between smoothness of returns and actual risk in many instances. I offer two examples to support this statement: One concerns a strategy that worked quite well for several years and then stopped working altogether with spectacular results at Long-Term Capital Management; and the second still is employed by many funds that have been delivering excellent returns but have the potential for the same sort of blowup. When Genius Failed Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) used a strategy that relied on very high leverage and the tendency for the price of ﬁxedincome bonds to converge in certain circumstances. Its use of very high leverage caused its posi
