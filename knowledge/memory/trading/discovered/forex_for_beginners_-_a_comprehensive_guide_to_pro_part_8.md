Chapter 7. At the end of every fiscal year, multinational companies will typically repatriate a significant portion of its earnings in order to pay taxes and dividends. For a period of a few weeks, these flows are often significant enough to influence exchange rates. This is especially true for Japanese multinationals, which are primarily export-oriented and must convert billions worth of foreign currency back into yen. When you consider that non-financial customers account for more than $500 billion (about 13%) in daily forex turnover, it is immediately apparent that multinational companies are doing more than simply exchanging currency for risk management purposes. Instead, many corporations engage in forex trading for speculative purposes. Some are prodded into doing so by their financial advisers while others engage in speculative forex trading under their own accord. In fact, it’s not uncommon for a multinational company’s forex activities to cause it to swing from profit to loss, or vice versa. At the very least, most global companies will recognize the impact of exchange rates on their bottom lines when they release their quarterly earnings. During the height of the 2008 credit crisis—when exchange rates were fluctuating wildly—Hong Kong–based CITIC Group shocked the markets when it announced a $2 billion loss from “unauthorized” forex trades.
