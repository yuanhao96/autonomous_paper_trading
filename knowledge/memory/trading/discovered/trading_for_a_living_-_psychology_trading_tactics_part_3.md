Chapter 10, "Risk Management"). A sensible trader never risks more than 2 percent of account equity on any trade. For example, if you have $30,000 in your account, you may not risk more than $600 per trade, and if you have $10,000, you may not risk more than $200. If your account is small, limit yourself to trading less expensive markets, or mini-contracts. If you see an attractive trade but your stop would have to be placed where more than 2 percent of equity would be at risk-pass that trade. Avoid risking more than 2 percent on a trade the way a recovering alcoholic avoids bars. If you are not sure how much to risk, err on the side of caution. If you blame excess commissions on a broker and slippage on a floor trader, you give up control of your trading life. Try to reduce both, but take responsibility for them. If you lose even a dollar more than your businessman's risk, including commissions and slippage, you are a loser. Do you keep good trading records? Poor record-keeping is a sure sign of a gambler and a loser. Good businessmen keep good records. Your trading records must show the date and price of every entry and exit, slippage, commissions, stops, all adjustments of stops, reasons for entering, objectives for 10. LOSERS ANONYMOUS 37 exiting, maximum paper profit, maximum paper loss after a stop was hit, and any other necessary data. If you bail out of a trade within your businessman's risk, it is normal business. There is no bargaining, no waiting for another tick, no hoping for a change. Losing a dollar more than your established businessman's risk is like getting drunk, getting into a brawl, getting sick to your stomach on your way home, and waking up in the gutter with a headache. You would never want that to happen. A Meeting for One When you go to an AA meeting, you will see people who have not had a drink in years stand up and say: "Hello, my name is so-and-so, and I am an alcoholic." Why do they call themselves alcoholics after years of sobriety? Because if they think they have beaten alcoholism, they will start drinking again. If a person stops thinking he is an alcoholic, he is free to take a drink, then another, and will probably end up in the gutter again. A person who wants to stay sober must remember that he is an alcoholic for the rest of his life. Traders would benefit from our own self-help organization-I'd call it Losers Anonymous. Why not Traders Anonymous? Because a harsh name helps to focus attention on our self-destructive tendencies. After all, Alcoholics Anonymous do not call themselves Drinkers Anonymous. As long as you call yourself a loser, you focus on avoiding losses. Several traders have argued against what they thought was the "negative thinking" of Losers Anonymous. A retired woman from Texas, a highly successful trader, described her approach to me. She is very religious and thinks it would not please the Lord for her to lose money. She cuts her losses very fast because of that. I thought that our methods were similar. The goal is to cut losses due to some objective, external rule. Trading within a businessman's risk is like living without alcohol. A trader has to admit that he is a loser, just as a drunk has to admit that he is an alcoholic. Then he can begin his journey to recovery. This is why every morning before trading I sit in front of the quote screen in my office and say: "Good morning, my name is Alex, and I am a loser. I have it in me to do serious financial damage to my account." This is like an AA meeting- it keeps my mind focused on the first principles. Even if I take 38 INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY thousands of dollars out of the market today, tomorrow I will say: "Good morning, my name is Alex and I am a loser." A friend of mine joked: "When I sit in front of my quote machine in the morning, I say, 'My name is John, and I'm gonna rip your throat out."' His thinking generates tension. "Losers Anonymous" thinking generates serenity. A trader who feels serene and relaxed can focus on looking for the best and safest trades. A trader who is tense is like a driver who freezes at the wheel. When a sober man and a drunk enter a race, you know who is more likely to win. A drunk may win once in a while thanks to luck, but the sober man is the one to bet on. You want to be the sober man in the race. 11. WINNERS AND LOSERS We come to the market from different walks of life and bring with us the mental baggage of our upbringing and prior experiences. Most of us find that when we act in the market the way we do in our everyday life, we lose money. Your success or failure in the market depends on your thoughts and feelings. It depends on your attitudes toward gain and risk, fear and greed, and on how you handle the excitement of trading and risk. Most of all, your success or failure depends on your ability to use your intellect rather than act out your emotions. A trader who feels overjoyed when he wins and depressed when he loses cannot accumulate equity because he is controlled by his emotions. If you let the market make you feel high or low, you will lose money. To be a winner in the market you must know yourself and act coolly and responsibly. The pain of losing scares people into looking for magic methods. At the same time, they discard much of what is useful in their professional or business backgrounds. Like an Ocean The market is like an ocean-it moves up and down regardless of what you want. You may feel joy when you buy a stock and it explodes in a rally. You may feel drenched with fear when you go short but the market rises and your equity melts with every uptick. These feelings have nothing to do with the market - they exist only inside you. 11. WINNERS AND LOSERS 39 The market does not know you exist. You can do nothing to influence it. You can only control your behavior. The ocean does not care about your welfare, but it has no wish to hurt you either. You may feel joy on a sunny day, when a gentle wind pushes your sailboat where you wan
