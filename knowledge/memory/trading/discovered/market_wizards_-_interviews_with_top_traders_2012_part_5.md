Part II-Mostly Stocks 95 Michael Steinhardt-The Concept of Variant Perception Michael Steinhardt's interest in the stock market dates back to his bar mitzvah, when his father gave him 200 shares of stock as a present. He recalls hanging out in the local brokerage office as a teenager, watching the ticker tape along with the old men, while his friends were out playing stickball. A very bright student, Steinhardt completed his education at an accelerated pace, graduating from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1960 at the age of nineteen. Steinhardt headed straight for Wall Street, landing his first job as a research assistant. In subsequent years, he held positions as a financial journalist and a research analyst. In 1967, having established a reputation as a talented analyst, Steinhardt and two other partners founded the investment firm of Steinhardt, Fine and Berkowitz—the predecessor to Steinhardt Partners. (Fine and Berkowitz left the firm in the late 1970s.) In the twenty-one years since its inception, Steinhardt's firm has achieved a truly remarkable track record. During that time, Steinhardt Partners has realized a compounded annual growth rate of over 30 percent (just under 25 percent after subtracting a 20 percent profit incentive fee). In comparison, the S&P 500 index registered only an 8.9 percent compounded annual growth rate (dividends included) during the same period. One thousand dollars invested with the firm at its start in 1967 would have grown to over $93,000 by Spring 1988 (after deducting prof it incentive fees). To put that in perspective, the same $1,000 invested in a basket of S&P stocks would only have grown to $6,400. Gain is only part of the story; Steinhardt's track record also demonstrates admirable consistency. Steinhardt Partners has only witnessed two losing years. In both cases, the net loss was under 2 percent before profit incentive fee adjustments. Steinhardt's superior performance has been achieved by using a myriad of approaches. He is both a long-term investor and a short-term trader; he is as comfortable shorting stocks as buying them; he will shift major chunks of the firm's capital into other investment vehicles, such as treasury securities, if he feels that is the best investment choice. To be sure, Steinhardt Partners' track record is not a solo performance. In addition to his cofounding partners, over the years, the firm has employed numerous traders and analysts. However, there was never any doubt that Steinhardt was clearly in charge. He reviews the firm's portfolio several times each day. Although he gives the firm's traders latitude to make their own judgments, Steinhardt will require a trader to rigorously justify his position if he has qualms about that position. If he feels strongly enough, Steinhardt will override the trader and liquidate the position. Steinhardt's extreme scrutiny and control of the firm's portfolio has given him a reputation of being a very demanding man to work for— obviously, too demanding for many of the traders who have left the firm over the years. Keeping in mind that Steinhardt's wraparound desk has been constructed in the shape of a ship's bow, it is not surprising that one journalist doing a profile tagged him with the sobriquet, Captain Ahab. However, Steinhardt's tough side is very much related to his job role—much as in football coaching, toughness is probably a virtue in managing a group of traders. I never saw Steinhardt's tough side. The man I interviewed was relaxed, soft spoken, patient, and good humored. (Of course, our interviews were always conducted outside of market hours.) Steinhardt possesses a keen sense of humor. He has been known to call friends impersonating an IRS agent, deliberately mumble fictitious orders to brokers right before the market close, and double-talk in a Dr. Irwin Corey -like manner when he wishes to pull the leg of an analyst or reporter who calls him. His conversation is also liberally sprinkled with Yid-dishisms— "proprietary dreck," for example, is how he refers to newfangled fund products. What are the major elements of your trading philosophy? The word "trading" is not the way I think of things. I may be a trader in the sense that my frequency of transactions is relatively high, but the word "investing" would apply just as much, if not more. In my mind, trading implies an anticipation of a sale at the time of purchase. For example, if I go long stock index futures tonight because I expect tomorrow's trade number will be bullish for the market, and I plan to sell my position tomorrow—that is trading. The bulk of what I do is for a much longer duration and for more complex reasons. For example, when I went long the debt 96 markets in 1981, I held that position for two and a half years. Well, for purposes of this book, I would still call what you are doing trading. How then do you define the difference between trading and investing? I make two key distinctions. First, a trader will go short as readily as long. In contrast, the investor—for example, the portfolio manager of a typical mutual fund—will always be long. If he is uncertain about the market, he may be only 70 percent invested, but he is always long. The second distinction I make is that a trader is primarily concerned about the direction of the market. Is the market, or stock, going up or down? The investor is more concerned about picking the best stocks to invest in. There is no value judgment involved in my distinction between traders and investors, it is merely a matter of maintaining a certain thematic focus for this book. In any case, on both counts, I would certainly qualify you as a trader. To get back to my original question: How would you define your philosophy of trading? My particular style is a bit different from that of most people. Concept number one is variant perception. I try to develop perceptions that I believe are at variance with the general market view.
