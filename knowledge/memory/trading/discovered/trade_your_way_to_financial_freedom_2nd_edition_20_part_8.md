Chapter 5). Their work is very insightful and helpful I deeply appreciate your contributions. I’d also like to acknowledge our first graduates-Webster Management. Three key people at Webster met at my school for professional traders. They have achieved tremendous success by understanding the key components necessary for investment and trading success+xpectancy and money management. I’d particularly like to acknowledge the contributions to my thinking from Paul Emery, Rob Friedl, Parker Sroufe, and Paul Rusnock. Chuck Branscomb has been a great model for me of how to adopt these principles. When he first came to my seminars, he thought he had a great system-when he really had no system at all, just some entry signals. He’s attended all my system seminars (except for one held in London) and most of the other seminars. I’ve watched him evolve into a very knowledgeable systems trader. He’s also a great example of how solid “intuition” about the market evolves out of solid systems trading. Chuck is the editor of our newsletter, Market Mastery, and several excerpts from Chuck’s work were put into this book. In addition, Chuck helped tremendously in generating some of the graphics in this book. John Humphreys is the senior developer of Athena Money Management software used in this book. John has incorporated all my suggestions about money management into the software to the point where one can now begin to see the millions of possibilities that exist in money management, which I call “position sizing” throughout this book. I knew position sizing was critical when the project started, but now that I can actually see the results of using the software I know that its importance is beyond anything that I had imagined. I’d like to thank everyone in my supertrader program. Several of them-William Curtiss and Rolf Sigrist-who continually bounce their great, creative ideas off me, have helped shape my thinking tremendously through their education process. I’d also like to thank Loyd Massey and Frank Gallucci for their tremendous suggestions in reviewing the manuscript. I’d also like to thank Bruce Feingold, Sir Mark Thomson, Dennis Ullom, Willard (“Buddy”) Harper, Andreas Pfister, Corky Dobbs, and Jim Hetherington for the tremendous insights I’ve gained from working with them. Some very special teachers in my life deserve a special mention. These include Connierae Andreas, Deepak Chopra, Robert Dilts, Todd Epstein, John Grinder, Tad James, Robert Kivosaki, John Overdurf, James Sloman, Enid Vien, and Wyatt Woo&mall. Your contribution to my personal evolution has been tremendous. I’d like to thank my editors at McGraw-Hill for their wonderful help. Stephen Isaacs miraculously appeared when I needed a publisher and John Morriss was very helpful throughout the production process. Lastly, but not least, I’d like to thank my staff at I.I.T.M., Inc. for their support in completing this book. Cathy Hasty has been a great help in laying out the book and with the graphics. Annette French has always “been there” to assist me with whatever was necessary. My deepest thanks go to all of you and to the many people who also contributed, but were too numerous to mention. xix PREFACE A number of my clients have asked me not to include certain sections in this book, with the admonishment of “You’re giving away too much.” Yet my job is to coach traders and investors to achieve peak performance. Every available tool is important in attempting to do that, because so much misinformation is available in the literature that the average person will constantly be led astray Most of the misinformation is not deliberate. People want to be led astray. They constantly ask the wrong questions, and those selling information get rewarded by giving them the answers they want. For example: . What’s the market going to do now? . What should I buy now? . I own XYZ stock. Do you think it’s going to go up? (If you say no, then they’ll ask someone else until they find a person who agrees with their opinion.) . Tell me how I can get into the market and be “right” most of the time. In April 1997, I did a Z-day seminar in Germany. Toward the end of the seminar, I gave the participants the choice of doing an exercise dealing with self-sabotage (which all of them needed) or asking me questions. They took a vote on what to do. Guess what the first question asked of me was? “Dr. Tharp, what’s your opinion about what the U.S. stock market will do for the rest of 1997?” This was despite my best efforts over the past two days to explain to them why such questions were unimportant. When people move beyond questions of “what” to buy into questions about “how,” they still ask the wrong questions. Now the question becomes something like: What criteria should I use to enter the market in order to be right most of the time? ui xxii Preface There is a large industry available to give you the answer to such questions. Hot investment books are filled with entry strategies that the authors claim to be 80 percent reliable or to have the promise of big gains. A picture tends to be worth a thousand words, so each strategy is accompanied by a graph in which the market just took off. Such “best-case” pictures can sway a lot of people and sell a lot of books. At an investment conference in 1995, a well-known speaker on the futures markets talked about his high-probability entry signals. The room was packed as he carefully explained what to do. Toward the end of the talk, one person raised his hand and asked, “How do you exit the market?” His response, albeit facetiously, was, “You want to know all my secrets, don’t you?” At another conference about a year later, the keynote speaker gave an hour talk before 600 people on high-probability entry techniques. Everyone listened eagerly at every word. Nothing was said about exits except that one should keep a tight stop and pay close attention to money management. After the talk, this particular speaker sold $10,000 worth of
