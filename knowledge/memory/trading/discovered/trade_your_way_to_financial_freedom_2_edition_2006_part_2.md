Chapter 1 of this book is: “The Legend of the Holy Grail.” “The Holy Grail” is a phrase you often hear in some trading and investment circles. Most people believe that it refers to some mysterious trading system out there that is going to make them millions with little or no risk. It’s not that at all. But before I tell you about the Holy Grail, let me tell you a little about who I am and why Dr. Tharp asked me to write the Foreword to his book. I started managing other peoples’ money in 1992 and in just 5 years those assets have grown from about $3 million to about $50 million. That has happened partially because my hedge fund has compounded by better than 40 percent per year, net to investors, over the last 5 years. We were up 61 percent net to investors in 1996 and 53 percent net to investors in 1997. Since I met Dr. Tharp, my net worth has grown many times over, and I do believe that it comes from adopting many of the Holy Grail secrets contained in this book. I think that Dr. Tharp understands and teaches those,secrets better than anyone else I have ever met. Let me tell you why: When I was a young boy, I remember dreaming that I would become a millionaire by the time I reached 25 years of age. I reached that goal through real estate development in 1981, but only briefly and then it all came tumbling down around me. I was devastated, but I picked myself up and started again. My next attempt at real success was in the investment field. Yet I almost had a similar type of crash in my fortunes. I remember the day clearly. I was sitting in my office in Naples, Florida, in late 1992. It was a typical south Florida autumn day. I was watching the palm trees sway in the breeze outside my window, wondering why my trading had become more difficult since I began managing money for others. I wasn’t about to crash at the xiii time, but I had the same sort of feeling in my gut that I had had before my first crash. My interests in investing began in 1967, when I would make regular trips to the local public library to devour every book I could find on investing. I’d also study biographies of successful businesspeople. I certainly wish I had been aware of Dr. Tharp’s modeling work back then, because it would have saved me so much time and so many heartaches. In 1969, at the age of 13, I talked my reluctant parents into opening a brokerage account for me at the local Merrill Lynch office in Toledo, Ohio. The conditions of the account: I had to fund the account myself from lawn mowing and odd jobs, and every trade had to be confirmed by my mother since it was a Unified Gift to Minors Act account. Once open, my father would occasionally give me a little money to put into the account, as long as I didn’t tell my mom. As I looked out the window, I realized how fortunate I was. I now lived in a tropical climate. I had probably again achieved my childhood dream of success doing something I loved to do. Twenty-two years had gone by since I made my first trade; only now I was doing it successfully. Yet, somehow, I was now beginning to find trading difficult. That nervous feeling helped me open up to whole new levels of success-way beyond those of my first childhood dreams. That feeling was the key to what was going on, and the key to my success, but I didn’t know what that key was- not yet at least. A few days later, I notice a magazine ad about Dr. Van Tharp. I had read about him in Jack Schwager’s book Market Wizards, so I decided to give him a call. That call was the start of a close professional and personal relationship that would end up affecting my life, my family, and even my business interests and associates. I already understood many of the secrets contained in this book. However, through my association with Dr. Tharp, I now understood the ultimate aspect of the Holy Grail secret-the part that Dr. Tharp so eloquently describes in
