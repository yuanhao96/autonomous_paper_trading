Chapter 4 covers the continuation patterns. This separation was done to add convenience and simplify future reference. This is mentioned here because the determination of bullish or bearish implications has to do only with continued price action and not with previous action. Previous price movement helps to determine only the pattern, not its ability to foresee or anticipate future price movement. Whether a reversal pattern or a continuation pattern, investment and trading decisions still need to be made, even if it is the fact that you decide to do nothing.
