Section 01 | Introduction and key concepts How leverage works Leverage “Leverage” simply means borrowed funds. While the high degree of leverage used in forex trading magnifies returns and risks, a few safety precautions used by professional traders may help mitigate these risks. Example Tips & Warnings You decide to buy 100,000 EUR and sell USD at a rate of 1.4100. Do you need more than 100,000 US dollars to open the trade? No! With a leverage of 1:50 you will need to put down only 1/50 of the deal size as the margin, which works out to $2,820. Leverage is a very aggressive investment strategy and only those with high risk tolerance should consider using big leverage. Calculate the margin: Leverage 1:50 Divide 100,000 by 50=2000 EUR 2000 EUR x 1.41=$2,820 Margin=$2,820 This is the amount that will be used to cover your potential losses. In other words, the margin is the actual amount that you are risking to lose if the trade goes against you. Use leverage appropriate to your comfort level: Using 1:50 leverage means that a 2% adverse move could wipe out all your equity or margin. If you are a relatively cautious investor or trader, use a lower level of leverage with perhaps 1:5 or 1:10 leverage. The leverage available on positions carried over the weekend may vary. Maximum leverage limits vary in different countries, varying from 1:10 to 1:400. Use Stop Loss orders! Stops can be used not just to ensure that losses are capped, but also to protect profits.
