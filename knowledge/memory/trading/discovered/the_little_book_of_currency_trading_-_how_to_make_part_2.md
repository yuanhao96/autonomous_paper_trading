Chapter 2. The subprime crisis that began in the United States and the European sovereign debt crisis may have lifted currencies from the business news to the headline news, but the popularity of currencies is not particularly new. Over the past 10 years, the forex market has grown significantly. Back in 2004, the Bank for International Settlements reported that the daily turnover in the forex market was approximately $1.9 trillion. When they released their triennial survey again in 2010, volume had increased to $4 trillion. For the first time ever, banks also did more transactions with “other financial institutions” (think retail forex brokers) than with other banks. Therefore, a large part of the growth in foreign exchange can be attributed to individual investors discovering the opportunities in forex trading. Turning Headlines into Opportunities If history tells us anything (and we know it does), there will be more crises, large and small, in various parts of the world over the next 10 years. When they occur, you will have the choice of being on the offense or the defense. So as my Aunt Judy always asked, how will you turn lemons into lemonade? Hindsight is always 20/20; in retrospect, it is easy say that dot-com companies with zero to negative earnings did not deserve their skyhigh valuations or that people would eventually stop paying astronomical prices for homes, especially as inventory flooded the market and consumers became overburdened with debt. The key is to not get caught up in the madness and be able to think rationally about whether the price of the asset is appropriate given the risks and valuations. Of course, this is easier said than done, but not impossible if we consider the different ways that a small investor could have capitalized on the recent crises. Let’s start off with the subprime crisis. As we all know, the crisis caused a number of financial institutions to fail. Some were seized by the government; others were rescued, sold to competitors, or forced into bankruptcy. Although some people may argue that it is immoral to profit from someone else’s misfortune, that was how Soros, Paulson, and Templeton made a large part of their wealth. Exhibit 1.1 is a daily chart illustrating how the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen—known as the USD/JPY currency pair—behaved after the failure of major financial institutions. The first arrow points to the time when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized. The second arrow indicates when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. The third arrow points to when Washington Mutual collapsed, and the fourth indicates when the U.S. government was forced to rescue Citigroup. As you can see, in each case the currency pair extended its losses. Even rescues or acquisitions failed to lift the dollar on the fear that more trouble would come. Those investors who sold dollars against the Japanese yen during the subprime crisis were handsomely rewarded.

Moving on to the European sovereign debt crisis, as the events in Greece unfolded and it became more apparent that the country was headed for financial trouble, credit rating agencies began to slash its debt rating. A credit rating agency is a company that assigns credit ratings that are meant to show the likelihood of an issuer defaulting on its debt. Ratings are given in the form of letter grades, almost like a report card. When a country’s rating is downgraded, it means that, for one reason or another, they’ve become more likely to default on their debt. In October 2009, one of the leading credit rating agencies, Fitch Ratings, downgraded Greece’s sovereign debt rating to A–, triggering what later turned into a 20 percent sell-off in the euro (EUR) against the U.S. dollar. As in the case of the USD/JPY, each time Greece or another sick country within the Eurozone was downgraded, the EUR/USD sold off. These downgrades set off waves of concern among investors because it meant that the country was moving closer and closer to defaulting on its loans. By April 2010, Greece’s debt ratings had been slashed to junk levels. One way to capitalize on the crisis would have been to turn the headlines into trading opportunities—or, in other words, sell when the panic begins because one downgrade will often be followed by another. Even if you don’t feel comfortable turning the stories into opportunities and prefer to trade on chart levels, you could have capitalized on the moves in both currency pairs by selling the breaks of key levels. For example, 105, 100, and 95 were all important psychological levels in the USD/JPY. The same is true for 1.45, 1.40, 1.35, and 1.30 in the EUR/USD. Currencies are trending in nature, especially during times of panic, and therefore, joining a move may yield better results than fading it. If you are not patient enough to sit with a trade for long, you can consider something shorter term in the direction of the prevailing market sentiment. For example, after a downgrade, you may want to look for opportunities to sell the EUR/USD for a short-term potential profit, assuming that trouble begets more trouble with a stop to limit the losses. Get It? Got It? Good! Financial crises are becoming increasingly common. But not everyone is a loser! Legendary investors like Sir John Templeton have shown that there are bargains to be found during times of crisis. Some professional money managers such as George Soros and John Paulson were smart to anticipate recent market meltdowns and profited big-time. In times of crisis, currency trading is a way to turn headlines into opportunities. Chapter Two Rubles and Bahts and Euros—Oh, My!
