Armed with high-tech tools, these new traders access Wall Street via their home computers in a search for the Promised Land. Although the art of speculation in all of its forms has existed for centuries, the financial media label these online traders as common gamblers who missed the bus to Atlantic City. The use of skill rather than luck separates profitable speculation from gambling. Now that the gates to Wall Street are open to all who wish to compete, smart speculators will hone their trading skills and apply the right tools as they attempt to become masters of their profession. Education is the essential element in building success in any discipline, and trading is no exception. Fortunately, you are already on the right path if you are reading these words. You are seeking your trading education from one of the best instructors in the industry today. My dear friend Alan Farley teaches traders across the globe how to master the art of highprobability short-term trading. He founded Hard Right Edge (http://www.hardrightedge.com), an excellent website for short-term traders and a comprehensive online resource that provides thousands of traders with educational materials on a daily basis. Alan is also an active message board participant, generously answering challenging questions from both new traders and market professionals. He has a true passion for teaching the beginner how to avoid the mistakes and pitfalls associated with short-term trading. When I asked Alan how he finds the time to answer all of those questions, he told me that he makes the time because new traders depend on veteran traders to give them good advice. ‘‘If I manage to save only one new trader from making a costly mistake, then it is well worth my time,” Alan said. Alan is determined to provide high-end education and has joined me on several occasions as we took center stage to teach at national online trading events. Although our compensation is small, I always look forward to spending time with him because he has true character and a great sense of humor. The greatest thing about his success is the fact that he has done very well just being himself. He is an asset to the trading community, and I am proud to be his friend. Trade Smart! Tony Oz President, Stockjunkie.com Author of Stock Trading Wizard: Advanced Short-Term Trading Strategies and The Stock Trader: How I Make a Living Trading Stocks June 2000 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Many friends and associates helped in the creation of The Master Swing Trader. I will fondly recall their invaluable assistance for many years to come. Writing any book is a hard task even for an accomplished writer. Writing a good book that may help thousands of swing traders beat the game is far more difficult. The following individuals should take pride in knowing that they played an important role in raising the bar of swing trading knowledge. Special thanks to Tony Oz for many hours of late-night discussion about the modern trading press and its many complications. His mentoring and friendship are greatly appreciated. Also, warm, personal thanks to Tim Bourquin, Jim Sugarman, Joe Bettencourt, and Hillary Marks for allowing a new voice to speak at national trading Expos. These dedicated individuals represent the bright future of trading education, and their influence on the financial world should persist for decades to come. A very grateful acknowledgement to Ross Ditlove and the MB Trading team in El Segundo, California, for a Townsend Real Tick account that allowed me to produce high-quality illustrations for the book. MB Trading presents a professional direct-access broker choice. They also offer readers $5.00 trades for the first 60 days after a new account opens. Call them at 1-888-790-4800 for details. I must acknowledge David Singerman, a graduate of my online trading course and very nice guy, for his endless hours reading and commenting on the book manuscript. His eye for small details goes well beyond my capabilities, and his efforts are greatly appreciated. Thanks for the special guidance of other professional traders and their ability to teach me new things each day. Perish the thought that all there is to know about the financial markets has already been written. It certainly has not, and these are the brilliant individuals who will continue to offer inspiration in the coming years: Mark Seleznov, Eric Patterson, Joe DiNapoli, Michael Turner, Teresa Lo, Rogan LaBier, Oswald Castillo, Linda Bradford Raschke, Michael Williams, Chris Wheeler, Geoff Mott, Steve Bell, Brandon Frederickson, Toni Hansen, and Vadym Graifer. A special thank you to members of the media and website community for making online trading one of the most powerful financial forces of the new century and allowing Hard Right Edge to be part of that juggernaut: Mark Etzkorn, Frank Kollar, Michelle Riley, Todd Switzer, Noble Ershad, Dave Huff, Tom Nelson, Teresa Carey, Gary Smith, Tom Perry, Angela Alaimo, Dennis Shepherd, Chuck Thompson, and Josh Friedman. Finally, warm acknowledgement to two Californians who talk me down whenever the trip gets really strange: Steve Moebius and Ste
