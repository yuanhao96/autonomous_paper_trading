Chapter 22) confirming the price downtrend. Its upturn signaled an upside reversal, confirmed by new price peaks 6 and 8. We’ve looked at false breakouts in the previous chapter, and you can see them again in action here. False breakouts occur when prices cross their support or resistance lines, spend one or two days beyond that line, and then return, marking a failed move in the direction of the breakout; afterwards prices tend to turn in the opposite direction. Here, a false downside breakout, followed by the upturn of a moving average gave a strong buy signal. We see a mirror image of this pattern after the top 8. There are two false upside breakouts, and after the second one, the moving average turns down, giving a sell signal. At the right edge of the chart, prices are pulling back up to their declining moving average. Such patterns tend to create good opportunities for selling short. 62 CLASSICAL CHART ANALYSIS Mass Psychology When the trend is up, bulls are more eager than bears, and their buying forces prices higher. If bears manage to push prices down, bulls return to bargain hunt. They stop the decline, and force prices to rise again. A downtrend occurs when bears are more aggressive and their selling pushes markets down. Whenever a flurry of buying lifts prices, bears sell short into that rally, stop it, and send prices to new lows. When bulls and bears are about equal in strength, prices stay in a trading range. When bulls manage to push prices up, bears sell short into that rally and prices fall. As they decline, bargain hunters step in and buy. Then, as bears cover shorts, their buying helps fuel a rally. This cycle can go on for a long time. A trading range is like a fight between two equally strong street gangs. They push one another back and forth, but neither can control the city block. A trend is like a fight in which a stronger gang chases the weaker gang down the street. Every once in a while the weaker gang stops and puts up a fight but then turns and runs again. Crowds spend most of their time aimlessly milling around, which is why markets spend more time in trading ranges than in trends. A crowd has to become agitated and surge to create a trend. Crowds do not stay excited for long—they go back to aimlessness. Professionals tend to give the benefit of the doubt to trading ranges. The Hard Right Edge Trends and ranges are easy to see in the middle of a chart, but as you get close to its right edge, the picture becomes increasingly foggy.The past is fixed and clear, but the future is fluid and uncertain. Trends are easy to recognize on old charts, but, unfortunately, our brokers don’t allow us to trade in the past—we have to make trading decisions at the hard right edge. By the time a trend becomes perfectly clear, a good chunk of it is already gone. Nobody will ring a bell when a trend dissolves into a trading range. Many chart patterns and indicator signals contradict one another at the right edge of the chart. You have to base your decisions on probabilities in an atmosphere of uncertainty. Most people feel very uncomfortable dealing with uncertainty. When their trade doesn’t go the way their analysis suggested, they hang onto losing positions, waiting for the market to turn and make them whole. Trying to be right is an unaffordable luxury in the markets. Professional traders get out of losing trades fast. When the market deviates from your analysis, you have to cut losses without fuss. Methods and Techniques Keep in mind that there is no single magic method to clearly and reliably identify all trends and trading ranges. It pays to combine several analytic tools. None of them is perfect, but when they confirm each another, a correct message is much more likely. When they contradict one another, it’s better to pass up a trade.

(Chart by Stockcharts.com) Trend Identification The single most important identifier of any trend is the pattern of its highs and lows. Look, for example, at this daily chart of Union Pacific Corp (UNP). Once it broke out of its trading range, its highs, marked by horizontal green lines, kept reaching higher and higher. Similarly, its reaction lows, marked by red horizontal lines, kept bottoming out at higher and higher levels. Trying to draw a trendline would be a very subjective exercise because the bottoms of UNP did not line up in a straight line. The 22-day exponential moving average (EMA), represented by a red line superimposed on prices, confirms the uptrend by its steady rise. Notice excellent buying opportunities, signaled by quick price dips to their moving average (we’ll return to this pattern in
