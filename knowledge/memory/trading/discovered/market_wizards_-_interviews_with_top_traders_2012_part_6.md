Chapter 11. The last trade was at 7, and the seller didn't bother to check the board. I bought 700,000 shares at 6'/8. The seller was relieved to sell that amount of stock at less than a dollar under the last trade. Meanwhile, I turned around and sold the 700,000 shares at 61.1 could have sold three times that amount at that price. I made a half million dollars on that trade, and it took me all of twelve seconds. How long did that environment last? Until the consolidated tape in 1975. Now there is a lot more competition; the people on the trading desks are much brighter. Another change is that retail buyers and sellers have diminished greatly in importance. The market has become institutionalized. Individuals buy stock through mutual funds. Brokerage firms don't sell customers stocks so much as they sell those horrible mutual funds and other awful things they call "financial products." Perhaps the most important change is that the world has become much more short term oriented. All sorts of people who used to be investors are now traders. The institutions now define themselves as enterprises whose goal is to achieve the highest rate of return, when they used to define themselves as long-term investors. People's confidence in their ability to predict secular trends has greatly diminished. In 1967, it would be typical to see a report by a brokerage firm estimating McDonalds' per share earnings up to the year 2000. Those people thought they could estimate long-term earnings because companies were growing in a stable and predictable way. They believed in America and steady growth. Today, stocks don't lend themselves to the same type of secular analysis. The implication of secular growth trend analysis not having worked in the 1970s and 1980s relates to the question of trading. In the 1950s and 1960s, the heroes were the long-term investors; today, the heroes are the wise guys. There are people like Goldsmith, who lauds the virtues of capitalism. He talks about "what I did for Goodyear." What did he do for Goodyear? He was in there for seven months, made eight zillion dollars for himself, and left the management after taking greenmail. He talks about what he did for Goodyear, because he is uncomfortable and has to somehow associate himself with the capitalist process. He and these other people have to bitch and moan about management, but they don't know their ass from their elbow about running companies. With the breakdown of certain laws, people are allowed to do things they weren't allowed to do before. What laws are you referring to? The Justice Department's reinterpretation of takeover laws; the definition of what is and is not monopolistic. What would be the most important advice you could give to the layman? One of the allures of this business is that sometimes the greatest ignoramus can do very well. That is unfortunate because it creates the impression that you don't necessarily need any professionalism to do well, and that is a great trap. So the major advice I would give anybody is: Recognize that this is a very competitive business, and that when you decide to buy or sell a stock, you are competing with people who have devoted a good portion of their lives to this same endeavor. In many instances, these professionals are on the opposite side of your trades and, on balance, they are going 105 to beat you. Is the implicit message that, most of the time, the novice trader would be better off having his money professionally managed? The term professionally managed implies a credit I am not sure I would give the average professional in this business. My point is that you should have a good reason to assume that you are going to achieve a significantly superior return for investing in stocks. If you can get 9 percent or 10 percent by investing in T-bonds and 7 percent or 8 percent by investing in T-bills, what should you get in stocks to offset the incremental risk? Probably something much higher. You have to decide what that number should be, and whether you have a realistic chance of achieving it. Don't underestimate the difficulty of the game. Right, and forget the shibboleth that stocks are going to give you a higher rate of return because they are more risky. That is not true. They are more risky; therefore, you have to be convinced that you are going to get a higher rate of return in order to play the game. Don't assume that by investing in some mutual fund, you are going to get a higher rate of return. Isn't that true, though? Historically, hasn't the stock market significantly beat interest rate returns? True, but there is a lot of statistical mumbo jumbo involved. Average return calculations depend heavily on the starting date. If you start in 1968 or 1972, for example, the numbers look a lot less appealing. What are the elements of good trading? Good trading is a peculiar balance between the conviction to follow your ideas and the flexibility to recognize when you have made a mistake. You need to believe in something, but at the same time, you are going to be wrong a considerable number of times. The balance between confidence and humility is best learned through extensive experience and mistakes. There should be a respect for the person on the other side of the trade. Always ask yourself: Why does he want to sell? What does he know that I don't? Finally, you have to be intellectually honest with yourself and others. In my judgment, all great traders are seekers of truth. Steinhardt's variant perception is basically a contrarian approach. But you can't be a successful contrarian by just using sentiment survey numbers or other measures of bullish consensus. The markets don't pay off that easily. Although sentiment is always very bullish at tops and very bearish at bottoms, unfortunately, extreme bullish and bearish readings are also characteristic of extended trends. The trick is not being a contrarian, but being a contrarian at the right time. Such judgments cannot be made on t
