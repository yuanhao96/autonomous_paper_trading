CHAPTER 2 INTRODUCTION TO THE FOREX 21 DEVALUATION By the late 1990s, stability issues arose in Europe, and major financial problems erupted in Asia. In 1997, there was a major currency crisis in Southeast Asia, which forced many of the countries’ economic currencies to float. The devaluation of currencies continued in the Asian currency markets, and confidence in trading the open Asian Forex markets began to fail. However, countries with stable currencies, and the concept of trading currencies, remained unchanged. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO By this point, the Europeans were already very comfortable with the concept of Forex trading, but the rest of the world was still unfamiliar. The establishment of the European Union in 1992 gave birth to the euro seven years later in 1999. The euro was the first single currency used as legal tender for the member states of the European Union and became the first currency to rival the historical leaders—the United States, Great Britain, and Japan—in the foreign exchange market by providing financial stability that Europe and the Forex market had long desired. WHAT IS THE FOREX? Forex is an acronym for foreign exchange, a market where people exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another in order to do business internationally. Typical situations in which such currency exchange is necessary include payments of import and export purchases and the sale of goods or services between countries. Forex is also called the cash market or spot interbank market. The spot market means trading on-the-spot, at whatever the price is at that moment. Prior to 1994, the Forex retail interbank market for small individual speculative investors or traders was not available. A speculative investor, or speculative trader, is one who looks to make a profit on price movement in the market and is not looking to hold onto any currency long-term. But with the average minimum transaction size of $1,000,000, smaller traders were all but excluded from participation in this market. Then in the late 1990s, retail market maker brokers (companies that facilitate the trades for speculative traders) were allowed to break up the large interbank units and offered individual traders the opportunity to participate in the Forex market as we know it today. 22 THE 10 ESSENTIALS OF FOREX TRADING Forex is considered the largest financial market in the world. The term market refers to a place where buyers and sellers are brought together to execute trading transactions. More than $1.5 trillion U.S. dollar is traded daily on the Forex. By comparison, $300 billion dollars is traded daily on the U.S. Treasury bond market and $100 billion dollars is traded daily on the U.S. stock market, for a total of $400 billion dollars per day. Forex trades nearly four times that volume daily, exceeding the daily combined activity of all the other financial markets. Forex has no physical location—transactions are placed via the Internet or telephone—but is composed of approximately 4,500 international world banks and retail brokers. Individual traders wanting to profit by speculating on price changes can only access this market through a Forex broker, such as I-TradeFX.com. It is a good practice of a speculative trader to only deal with Forex brokers that are regulated by the governmental bodies in their respective countries. TYPES OF TRADERS Trading currencies involves the fluctuation of one currency in relation to another. That is the main difference between trading currencies and stock trading—you always have to deal with two instruments, or currency pairs, whereas in stock trading you only deal with one instrument. The definition of a currency pair, or currency cross, is trading one currency for another currency, and you need a currency pair to execute a trade on the Forex. Speculative currency trading, just like speculative stock trading, involves exchanging one currency for another in anticipation of a price change in your favor. There are two types of traders on the Forex: consumer traders and speculative traders. A consumer trader wants long-term ownership and is not as concerned with daily price movements, whereas a speculative trader is only concerned with daily price movement, as that is where the profit potential is. Speculative traders are also called scalpers—they are trying to scalp a profit in a small price movement. Long-term position traders enter the market and stay in for a week, a month, or years. Short-term, or day traders, will enter the market for 5 minutes, 30 minutes, or even 4 hours, and then exit, but they are usually in and out within a 24-hour period. Although brokers will assure you that Forex trading is commissionfree, it is important that you understand there still are costs involved. That cost is called the spread, which is what you will be charged to get access to
