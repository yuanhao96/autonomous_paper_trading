Chapter 6. THE BODY ( JITTAI) The box that makes up the difference between the open and close is called the real body of the candlestick. The height of the body is the range between the day’s open price and the day’s close price. When this body is black, it means that the closing price was lower than the opening price. When the closing price is higher than the opening, the body is white. THE SHADOWS ( KAGE ) The candlestick line may have small thin lines above and/or below the body. These lines are called shadows and represent the high and low prices reached during the trading day. The upper shadow (uwakage) represents the high price and the lower shadow (shitakage) represents the lower price. Some Japanese traders refer to the upper Figure 1-3 䊏 8 Chapter One shadow as the hair and the lower shadow as the tail. It is these shadows that give the appearance of a candle and its wick(s). When drawing candlestick charts by hand, the Japanese use red instead of white to represent the up days (close higher than open). With the use of a computer, this is not feasible because red would be printed as black on most printers and you could not tell the up days from the down days. This also applies to photocopying. If you compare Figures 1-4 and 1-5, you can see that the Japanese candlestick chart really does not display anything different from the standard bar chart. However, once you become accustomed to seeing Figure 1-4 9 䊏 Introduction Figure 1-5 Japanese candlestick charts, you will prefer them because their clarity is superior and allows a quick and accurate interpretation of the data. This matter of interpretation is also what this book is about. Japanese candlestick charting and analysis will continue to grow and gain in popularity. For as long as it is used as intended, only a profit of doom would suggest its demise. This page intentionally left blank CHAPTER TWO Candlestick Lines A day of trading in any stock or futures market is represented in traditional charts by a single line or price bar; Japanese candlestick charting is no different, except that the information is so much more easily interpreted. There is much information provided in a single candle line. This will help in understanding the psychology behind the many candle patterns described in later chapters. There are a few candle patterns that consist of only a single candlestick and also qualify as reversal patterns. They will be covered thoroughly in the chapter on reversal patterns. Each type of candle line has a unique name and represents a possible trading scenario for that day. Some candle lines have Japanese names and some have English names. Whenever possible, if the name is in English, the Japanese name will also be given. The Japanese name will be written in a format called Romanji. This is a method of writing Japanese so that it can be pronounced properly by nonJapanese-speaking people. Single candle lines are often referred to as yin and yang lines. The terms yin and yang are Chinese, but have been used by western analysis to account for polar terms, such as 䊏 11 䊏 䊏 12 Chapter Two in/out, on/off, up/down, and over/under. (the Japanese equivalents are inn and yoh) Yin relates to bearish and yang relates to bullish. There are 9 basic yin and yang lines in candlestick analysis. These can be expanded to 15 different candle lines for a clearer explanation of the various possibilities. It will be shown in later chapters how most candle patterns can be reduced to single candle lines and maintain the same bullish or bearish connotations. LONG DAYS Reference to long days is prevalent in most literature dealing with Japanese candlesticks. Long describes the length of the candlestick body, the difference between the open price and the close price, as shown in Figure 2-1. A long day represents a large price movement for the day. In other words, the open price and the close price were considerably different. How much must the open and close price differ to qualify as a long day? Like most forms of analysis, context must be considered. Long compared to what? It is best to consider only the most recent price action to determine what is long and what is not. Japanese candlestick analysis is based solely upon the short-term price movement, so the determination of long days should be also. Anywhere from the previous 5 to 10 days should be more than adequate to produce the Figure 2-1 13 䊏 Candlestick Lines proper results. Other acceptable methods of determining long days may also be used. These will be thoroughly discussed in the chapter on pattern identification and the recognition. SHORT DAYS Short days, shown in Figure 2-2, may also be based on the same methodology as long days, with comparable results. There are also numerous days that do not fall into any of these two categories. Figure 2-2 MARUBOZU Marubozu means close-cropped or close-cut in Japanese. Other interpretations refer to it as Bald or Shaven Head. In either case, the meaning reflects the fact that there is no shadow extending from the body at either the open or the close, or at both. Black Marubozu A Black Marubozu is a long black body with no shadows on either end (Figure 2-3). This is considered an extremely weak line. It often becomes part of a bearish continuation or bullish reversal candle pattern, especially if it occurs during a downtrend. This line, being black, shows the weakness of the continuing downtrend. A long black line could be a final sell off; this is why it is often the first day of many bullish reversal patterns. It is also called a Major Yin or Marubozu of Yin. 䊏 14 Chapter Two Figure 2-3 Figure 2-4 White Marubozu A White Marubozu (Figure 2-4) is a long white body with no shadow on either end. This is an extremely strong line when considered on its own merits. Opposite of the Black Marubozu, it often is the first part of a bullish continuation or bearish reversal candle pattern. It is sometimes called a Major Yang or Marubozu of Yang. Closing Maru
