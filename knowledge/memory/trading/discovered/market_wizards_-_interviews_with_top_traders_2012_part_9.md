Part V-The Psychology of Trading 195 Dr. Van K. Tharp-The Psychology of Trading Dr. Van K. Tharp is a research psychologist who received his Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma, Health Sciences Center, in 1975. He has spent his career studying how stress affects human performance. His strongest interest is in the psychology of winning—especially as winning applies to the markets. In 1982, Dr. Tharp developed his Investment Psychology Inventory, a test that measures winning and losing traits. Thousands of investors and speculators—myself included—have taken this test, which includes a written evaluation and a ten-minute phone consultation. Dr. Tharp has written five books on successful investing which provide the core of his investment course. He is a contributing editor for Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities and has also written numerous articles for other financial publications. Dr. Tharp is a frequent guest on financial television and radio programs, and has spoken at many investment conferences. Dr. Tharp currently devotes himself full time to counseling traders from his office in Glendale, California, and continuing his research on trading success. A recent focus of this research has been interviewing and studying top traders so that he could create a model for success. His basic theory is that by teaching the winning traits of the top traders (not specific trading methodologies), he can dramatically improve the performance of less successful traders and investors. In his most recent project, he is attempting to turn his most successful clients into "supertraders" by extending his normal program of two two-day sessions into an ongoing semiannual process. After I interviewed Dr. Tharp, he asked whether he could do a video tape interview of me as part of his ongoing research. Since I thought such an interview might be helpful in improving my own trading performance, I eagerly agreed. The interview lasted for over four hours. Dr. Tharp has a particularly probing questioning style. After an initial response to a question, he would ask, "What else?" and repeat this process several times. When I could no longer think of any additional responses, he would have me shift the direction of my gaze (he later explained this instruction was intended to facilitate accessing different parts of my brain), and sure enough I would think of another point I had somehow overlooked. I felt that this interview yielded some important personal insights. (One of these self-realizations is briefly discussed in the next chapter.) I would have liked to provide my personal impression of Dr. Tharp's basic course, which includes five books and four tapes. However, although I reviewed the material briefly as background for this chapter, the combination of simultaneously working at a full-time job and writing this book did not leave me with enough time (or energy) to give the course the serious attention it calls for—a personal project I plan for later. I can, however, attest to the fact that one of the traders interviewed in this book served as a subject in Dr. Tharp's project on modeling success and was duly impressed with his intellect and insight into successful trading. How did you first get interested in the connection between psychology and trading? My primary research interest after graduate school was how various drugs affect human performance. After receiving my Ph.D. in psychology, I spent about eight years doing fairly standard psychological research. For example, I helped standardize the current Field Sobriety Test Battery that police throughout the country are still using. While I was doing that, I also learned how to lose money trading options. In fact, I lost money so fast and so consistently that when I finally got out of the market, I had to conclude that the losses had something to do with me. During that same time period, I enrolled in a class in prosperity at the local Church of Religious Science. One of the principles taught in that class is that what happens to you reflects your mindset. I had read a lot on the psychology of trading, and while I considered most of that information to be "folklore," I wanted to test it out. I decided to do so by developing my Investment Psychology Inventory, a test to measure investment strengths and weaknesses, as a creative project for that class. No one in the class would take it, so I sent it to R. E. McMaster, the editor of a newsletter to which I was subscribing. McMaster took it and then offered it to his subscribers. Overall, I received close to a thousand responses and that really roused my interest in this area as a career. What did you learn in analyzing the responses to your test? Were there any major surprises? I had several measures of success built into the test, so I could rank the responses according to "success level." The investment literature suggested ten different areas that might be important. As 196 a result, I designed questions to measure each of those areas. I did a number of statistical analyses of the data and found a significant correlation between each area and investment success. In addition, I found that those ten areas could be grouped into three major clusters, which I label the psychological factor, the management and discipline factor, and the decision-making factor. Although I've since refined the test, I still use the same three major clusters. In addition, I still keep the ten original areas, and I've added an extra one—intuition. What are the eleven areas you measure? Well, the psychological factor has five areas. These include a well-rounded personal life, a positive attitude, the motivation to make money, lack of conflict, and responsibility for results. Motivation to make money is not significantly correlated with success, but I keep it in the test because lack of such motivation plus high conflict is very significant. There are three factors in the decision-making area. These include a solid knowledge of te
