Part 2 we will examine how these findings hold up on a more continuous basis. In­ cluded within is a series of six months of consecutive 5-minute sessions of the eur / usd. Besides providing a massive amount of study material, this series should leave little doubt behind as to the amazing continuity and exploitability of price action themes from one session to the next. One of the most common questions I rec.eived in response to my first book, Forex Price Action Scalping, was if the principles and setups pointed out on a fast scalping chart (70-tick) could also be applied to the higher intraday frames, like the 2 or 5-minute, or even the hourly for that matter. There can only be one answer to this question: price action principles are transposable to any time frame of choice because they bear within them the universal laws of supply and demand. This is not bounded by the time in which it takes place, nor is it a prerogative of any one market. From one instrument or time frame to another, subtle adaptations may be called for, if only to accommodate for the differ­ ences in average range or motion; but the trading concepts of the price action method are just as applicable to futures, indices, stocks, com­ modities, bonds, or what have you, as they are to the Forex markets. As will be demonstrated also, price action principles are not only free from the boundaries of market and frame, they stand above the nature of the trading environment as well. To illustrate this point, a special section is included on how to tackle a very persistent climate of low volatility by slightly tweaking standard procedure to better suit the conditions at hand. We will examine this adaptation process from the viewpoint of a faster intraday frame on several currency pairs and some popular non-Forex markets. VI Preface In regard to the absolute novice, it should be noted that to keep the fo­ cus at all times directed towards analysis, it is chosen not to disturb the pace of this book with endless pages of introductory fluff that is readily available either online or in more generic trading books. From a techni­ cal perspective, however, Understanding Price Action is written for both the novice and the experienced trader, and for all who have taken inter­ est in exploring the benefits and possibilities of the price action method.
