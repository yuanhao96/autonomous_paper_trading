CHAPTER 1 Three Must-Know Forex Facts Forex's Top Three Lessons The three most important lessons you'll ever learn about foreign exchange (forex) markets are: 1. Everyone needs forex diversification. Just as every competent investor needs to diversify by asset classes and sectors, so too they need exposure to assets in multiple currencies and an understanding of forex trends and what's driving them. Yet most have almost all their assets denominated in one or two currencies. Today, that is an especially fatal error, because the governments behind most major currencies intend to get out of debt by causing inflation, which allows them to repay their bonds with depreciated money. That's good for those governments, and disastrous for those holding their weakened currency and anything denominated in it. They won't admit it, but historically low interest rates and a steady stream of economic stimulus programs betray their real intentions. They want to reduce their real debt, and, in the process, your wealth, through the subtle tax of inflation. To protect yourself, you need as much of your assets as possible to be denominated in the currencies that are likely to hold their real value or appreciate in the long run, and lift your portfolio along with them. Having some commodities exposure is also a means of hedging this currency risk and playing forex trends, so both forex brokers and traders typically also deal with commodities. Thus while they're different asset classes, in practice forex tends to include commodity trading and investing. 2. Forex markets offer significant advantages over other asset markets. If trading with leverage, there is more risk, but that can be controlled and managed if you invest the time to learn and practice proper risk and money management (RAMM). You can benefit from forex without dealing with the added complications of RAMM issues (covered in Chapters 0 through 12). 3. You can succeed using forex trading or investing if you learn and practice what follows. FACT 1: EVERYONE NEEDS FOREX DIVERSIFICATION EVEN IF YOU DON'T TRADE ACTIVELY All those responsible for managing assets need some forex exposure and awareness of what drives forex markets. You're Exposed: Cover Your Assets Like it or not, you're exposed to currency risk. Every asset is denominated in some kind of currency. For example, consider the case of the US investor. Even if your portfolio has done well in U.S. dollar (USD) terms, over the past decades, the picture is less rosy against other major currencies and commodities. Because we all use imported products, this means your purchasing power and wealth are melting away if your assets are in a declining currency like the U.S. dollar. For example, anyone whose assets are too concentrated in U.S. dollars has paid the penalty countless times whether they realize it or not. Remember oil at $10 per barrel, or gas at $0.35 per gallon? Remember the bestselling guide for frugal tourists in the late 1950s, Europe on $5 a Day? The final version came out in 2007, Europe from $95 a Day .1 Remember how in the 1960s and early 1970s durable Japanese cars were considered inexpensive? This decline in purchasing power isn't just due to inflation. For example, the U.S. dollar has been in steady decline for decades against many other important currencies. Since 2000, the USD is down 32 percent versus the Canadian Dollar (CAD). Since 1990, the USD is down 52 percent versus the Japanese Yen (JPY). Since 1970, the USD is down 75 percent versus the Swiss Franc (CHF). Today, currency diversification is no longer optional. As governments maintain historically low interest rates and assorted stimulus plans that risk devaluing their currencies and your savings, currency diversification is as essential for your portfolio as sector and asset class diversification. Failure to do so is foolhardy. You don't have to be an active trader to ride the strongest long-term forex trends. We'll show you many ways that passive, longer-term investors can protect themselves. While Americans may be waking up to the need for currency diversification, that's hardly news to most of the world, which has dealt with this issue for years. In other areas of the world, like Japan or Italy, with histories of weak currencies, participation in forex trading is a widespread middle-class phenomenon. For example, Japanese housewives are such prominent participants in forex that they're referred to collectively as “Mrs. Wantanabe.”2 As an American student in Israel in the 1980s, I watched families run to spend their monthly pay check because its purchasing power would fall every day due to high inflation. In the mid-1980s, friends with dollars could exchange them for local currency at higher black market rates and purchase anything from cars to apartments in the local currency at a 40 percent discount. Even Long-Term Buy-and-Hold Investors Need Forex Diversification Therefore, just as wise investors diversify into different kinds of assets and sectors, they must also diversify into the different kinds of currencies, particularly those likely to appreciate versus their peers. As we'll discuss in Chapters 0 through 12, even long-term buy-and-hold passive investors who don't actively trade currencies can protect and grow their wealth by allocating portions of their portfolios to instruments denominated in the most promising currencies. Although most forex market participants are short-term speculators, currencies can be excellent long-term plays, because currency pairs tend to form stronger, more stable long-term trends compared to stocks. Why? Because the fundamentals of the underlying economies that drive currency prices change much more slowly than those of individual companies. It's a longer, more complex process to change the relative growth rates of entire economies (or currency unions in the case of the Euro) than it is for an individual company. Even better, unlike stocks, currencies don't all move together in
