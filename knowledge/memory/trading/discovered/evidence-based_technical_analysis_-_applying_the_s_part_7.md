CHAPTER 3 CIIJ\P1'ER 9 vii CONTENTS viii APPENDIX Proof That Detrending Is Equivalent to Benchmarking Based on Position Bias 475 Notes 477 Index 517 Acknowledgments hough a book is attributed to its author(s), it truly reflects the efforts of many more people. I wish to acknowledge those individuals without whom this book would have been impossible or a much lesser work. I am most indebted to Dr. Timothy Masters, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing for over 10 years. His patient and intelligent guidance kept me on a solid statistical footing. Tim not only gave me important feedback on technical issues but was responsible for coding and running the ATR rule experiments and the statistical routines used to test the over 6,400 rules examined. Tim also innovated the Monte Carlo permutation method as an alterative to the patented method of White, called RealityCheck, for testing the statistical significance of rules discovered by data mining. Tim has graciously decided to put the method in the public domain and has allowed it to be published for the first time here. Also crucial were the programming talents of Stuart Okorofsky and the database creation by Dr. John Wolberg. I am indebted Dr. Halbert White, inventor of Reality-Check and for the help of Professor David Jensen, director of the Knowledge Discovery Lab at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. I also wish to express my appreciation to the following people for reviewing and commenting on various chapters. Their feedback was essential: Charles Neumann, Lance Rembar, Dr. Samuel Aronson, Dennis Katz, Hayes Martin, George Butler, Dr. John Wolberg, Jay Bono, Dr. Andre Shlefier, Dr. John Nofsinger, Doyle Delaney, Ken Byerly, James Kunstler, and Kenny Rome. Special thanks to the helpful folks at John Wiley & Sons: Kevin Commins, for seeing the value of a critical appraisal of technical analysis, and Emilie Herman, for her steady hand in editing the book. Thanks as well to Michael Lisk and Laura Walsh. T ix About the Author David Aronson is an adjunct professor of finance at Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business in New York, where he teaches a graduate-level course in technical analysis to MBA and financial-engineering students, and vice-president of Hood River Research Inc., a firm that develops signal filters and predictive models. He was formerly a proprietary trader and technical analyst at Spear, Leeds and Kellogg and president of Raden Research Group Inc., a consulting firm that developed the data-mining software PRISM and filters and systems for various trading firms. Prior to that, he founded AdvoCom Corporation, which managed client funds in portfolios of futures trading advisors using portfolio optimization. He received a BA in philosophy from Lafayette College in 1967 and served in the Peace Corps in El Salvador. xi Introduction echnical analysis (TA) is the study of recurring patterns in financial market data with the intent of forecasting future price movements. I It is comprised of numerous analysis methods, patterns, signals, indicators, and trading strategies, each with its own cheerleaders claiming that their approach works. Much of popular or traditional TA stands where medicine stood before it evolved from a faith-based folk art into a practice based on science. Its claims are supported by colorful narratives and carefully chosen (cherry picked) anecdotes rather than objective statistical evidence. This book's central contention is that TA must evolve into a rigorous observational science if it is to deliver on its claims and remain relevant. The scientific method is the only rational way to extract useful knowledge from market data and the only rational approach for determining which TA methods have predictive power. I call this evidence-based technical analysis (EBTA). Grounded in objective observation and statistical inference (Le., the scientific method), EBTA charts a course between the magical thinking and gullibility of a true believer and the relentless doubt of a random walker. Approaching TA, or any discipline for that matter, in a scientific manner is not easy. Scientific conclusions frequently conflict with what seems intuitively obvious. To early humans it seemed obvious that the sun circled the earth. It took science to demonstrate that this intuition was wrong. An informal, intuitive approach to knowledge acquisition is especially likely to result in erroneous beliefs when phenomena are complex or highly random, two prominent features of financial market behavior. Although the scientific method is not guaranteed to extract gold from the mountains of market data, an unscientific approach is almost certain to produce fool's gold. This book's second contention is that much of the wisdom comprising the popular version of TA does not qualify as legitimate knowledge. T 1 2 INTRODUCTION KEV DEFIMTIONS: PROPOSITIONS AND ClAIMS, BELIEF AND KNOWLEDGE I have already used the terms knowledge and belief but have not rigorously defined them. These and several other key terms will be used repeatedly in this book, so some formal definitions are needed. The fundamental building block of knowledge is a declarative statement, also known as a claim or a proposition. A declarative statement is one of four types of utterances that also include exclamations, questions, and commands. Declarative statements are distinguished from the others in that they have truth value. That is to say, they can be characterized as either true or false or probably true or probably false. The statement "Oranges are on sale at the supermarket for five cents a dozen" is declarative. It makes a claim about a state of affairs existing at the local market. It may be true or false. In contrast, the exclamatory statement "Holy cow, what a deal," the command "Go buy me a dozen," or the question "What is an orange?" cannot be called true or false. Our inquiry into TA will be concerned with declarative statements, such as, "Rule X has predictive p
