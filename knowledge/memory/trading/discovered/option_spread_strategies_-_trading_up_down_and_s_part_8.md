Chapter 1 The Covered-Write they tend to keep their trades on a short leash, may only be in the trade a few days, and will exit at the first sign of trouble. Low Risk Appetite: The investor with a low risk appetite needs to collect more premium for downside protection; this forces him to write calls that are at- or even in-the-money or of longer duration. Writing calls that are at- or in-the-money creates a covered-write that has a defensive stance of neutral to slightly bearish, and this removes any chance for upside appreciation in the stock price. Writing calls of longer duration will generate a smaller time decay (theta), slowing potential income generation. What Is the Purpose of the Covered-Write? • Income Generation Time decay is the key to income generation, and, as we noted in the earlier discussion of theta in “Strategy Composition,” shorter-dated options have a higher rate of time decay (a larger theta) than longer-dated options, and at-the-money options have a higher rate of time decay than in- or outof-the-money options. This pushes the investor interested in income generation into the short-dated options. Of course, this has to be balanced with market view and risk appetite, which require some give and take, but, in general, covered writers interested in quick income generation need to be operating in the shorter-dated (forty-five days to expiry and less) options that are near-the-money. This produces maximum time decay. • Downside Protection The investor interested in protecting his portfolio needs to generate larger premiums when writing calls against his holdings. Calls that are inthe-money, or of longer duration, generally carry larger premiums. Writing calls that are in-the-money creates a covered-write that has more of a defensive stance, which offers greater downside protection. However, structuring a covered-write in this fashion eliminates most if not all of the potential for upside appreciation in the stock price. In addition, writing calls of longer duration will result in a smaller time decay (theta), thus slowing income generation and increasing the holding period for the trade. What Is the Current State of Implied Volatility in the Market? Implied volatility is determined by the current pricing of options in the marketplace. By using the current option price and an option pricing model, investors are able to solve for the volatility implied by the option price. An option calculator such as the one on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) website can make this calculation easier (www.cboe.com). Implied volatility reflects the consensus opinion of options market participants about what the expected volatility of the underlying will be through expiration. High implied volatility means that market participants are expecting high volatility in the price of the underlying through that Strategy Component Selection particular expiration cycle. Low implied volatility means that market participants are expecting low volatility in the price of the underlying through that particular expiration cycle. Implied volatility is in a constant state of flux as new information influences the market and alters the expectations of the participants. It is a “market” in and of itself. As we discussed in “Strategy Composition,” when we examined vega, rising implied volatility causes option prices to rise, while falling implied volatility causes option prices to fall. This has a direct impact on the covered-write because it is the premium generated by the sale of the call option(s) that determines the risk, reward, break-even point, and potential rate of return of the strategy. • High Implied Volatility As mentioned previously, high implied volatility means that market participants are expecting high volatility (that is, a lot of movement) in the price of the underlying through that particular expiration cycle. That means three things to the potential covered writer: • Market participants see risk in the price of the underlying. • Premiums may be elevated to reflect this risk. • Rates of return may be higher than normal to reflect this risk. Remember that the first and most important determining factor for a covered-write strategy is a neutral to moderately bullish forecast for the underlying price. High implied volatility is an indication that market participants have built in the possibility of greater than usual movement in the underlying price both to the upside and downside. In other words, they see risk and, because of that, option prices and rates of return on a covered-write are elevated to reflect this perceived risk. The investor who is confident of a neutral to bullish forecast for the stock and who has a view opposite the marketplace may be rewarded, if correct, by a higher than usual rate of return. But remember: It is the neutral to bullish price forecast that should be the first determining factor for a covered-write, never the rate of return! The rate of return is simply an indicator of the risk level perceived by market participants at that time. Using rate of return to determine covered-write strategies is a trap. • Low Implied Volatility Low implied volatility means that market participants are expecting low volatility (that is, a lack of movement) in the price of the underlying through that particular expiration cycle. That means three things to the potential covered writer: • Market participants may see low risk in the price of the underlying. • Premiums may be depressed to reflect this lack of risk. • Rates of return may be lower than normal to reflect this lack of risk. 19 20
