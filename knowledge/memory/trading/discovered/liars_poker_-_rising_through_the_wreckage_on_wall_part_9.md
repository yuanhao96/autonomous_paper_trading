documents for ninety and more hours a week. If they did this particularly well, analysts were thought well of by their bosses. This was a dubious honor. Bosses attached beepers to their favorite analysts, making it possible to call them in at all hours. A few of the very best analysts, months into their new jobs, lost their will to live normal lives. They gave themselves entirely over to their employers and worked around the clock. They rarely slept and often looked ill; the better they became at the jobs, the nearer they appeared to death. One extremely successful analyst working for Dean Witter in 1983 (a friend I envied at the time for his exalted station in life) was so strung out that he regularly nipped into a bathroom stall during midday lulls and slept on the toilet. He worked straight through most nights and on weekends, yet felt guilty for not doing more. He pretended to be constipated—in case someone noticed how long he had been gone. By definition an analyst's job lasted only two years. Then he was expected to go to business school. Many analysts later admit that their two years between college and business school were the worst of their lives. The analyst was a prisoner of his own narrowly focused ambition. He wanted money. He didn't want to expose himself in any unusual way. He wanted to be thought successful by others like him. (I tell you this only because I narrowly escaped imprisonment myself, and not by choice. And had I not escaped, I surely wouldn't be here now. I'd be continuing my climb up the same ladder as many of my peers.) There was one sure way, and only one sure way?, to get ahead, and everyone with eyes in 1982 saw it: Major in ecomomics; use your economics degree to get an analyst job on Wall Street; use your analyst job to get into the Harvard or Stanford Business Schiool; and worry about the rest of your life later. So, more than any other, the question tlhat my classmates and I were asking in the fall of 1981 and the spring of 1982 was: How do I become a Wall Street analyst? Over time this qiuestion had fantastic consequences. The first and most obvious was ai logjam at the point of entry. Any one of a number of hard statistics cam be enlisted to illustrate the point. Here's one. Forty percent of the tlhirteen hundred members of Yale's graduating class of 1986 applied tco one investment bank, First Boston, alone. There was, I think, a sense iof safety in the numbers. The larger the number of people involved, tHie easier it was for them to delude themselves that what they were dosing must be smart. The first thing you learn on the trading floor is that when large numbers of people are after the same commodity, be it a sstock, a bond, or a job, the commodity quickly becomes overvalued. Unfortunately, at the time, I had never seen a trading floor. The second effect, one that struck me at the time as tragic, was a strange surge in the study of economics. AVt Harvard in 1987 the course in the principles of economics
