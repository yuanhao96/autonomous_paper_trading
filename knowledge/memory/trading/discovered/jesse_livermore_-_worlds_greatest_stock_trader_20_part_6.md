open. The quotes had to be posted immediately and accurately; millions were riding. There were several ticker-tape machines in each room. The snaking tape was like the blood that flowed through his veins. It was life itself. He was never out of arm’s reach of a stock ticker. There were tickers in the main rooms of all his homes: Lake Placid, Long Island, the Manhattan apartment, the suite of rooms in the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, even on his 300-foot yacht. Livermore read the numerous New York Times articles that he had saved from the recent editions. All the papers blamed him for the calamitous crash, personally blamed him for initiating the decline—the precipitous free fall which now seemed to have no bottom. But he believed that business—in his case, the stock market—was like war. In war, you died if you made a mistake; in the stock market, if you made a mistake, you could go broke very fast. One could die, financially, in a heartbeat. Livermore was a serious person, and on this day he planned to do some serious business. He was impeccably dressed, as he was every day, in a handmade suit from Saville Row in London. His shirts were the latest style, made of the finest Egyptian cotton, monogrammed on the cuff. His suit hung perfectly from his slim frame, his silk tie subtly striped to blend in with it. His blond hair was combed back, parted on the left side.

He had a line out at the present time of over a million shares, well over $100 million. It had been placed months ago, slowly, secretly, and silently, using more than 100 stockbrokers, so nobody could tell what he was doing. He was short the market—he had sold stock that he would later supply, at a much lower price. He was living up to his reputation as the Great Bear of Wall Street. Today, he was like a lone wolf stalking the arctic tundra, looking for prey—and looking out for other predators that might kill him. There were plenty of Wall Street players he knew who could do just that—end his financial life with one deadly, hammering blow. He picked up one of the New York Times articles he had saved from October 20, and read the headline: “Stocks Driven Down in Wave of Selling.” He was careful not to gloat. There was no one who knew better than Livermore how fast things could change in the stock market. He read on:
