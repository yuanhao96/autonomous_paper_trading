Chapter 5, and (3) taxes. Whatever way one looks at it, the camel’s back is surely broken. But the very last straw, it turns out, is inflation.  Fund returns are devastated by costs, taxes, and inflation. When we pay our fund costs in current dollars, year after year—and that’s exactly how we pay our fund expenses and our taxes on fund capital gains (often realized on a TA X E S A R E C O S TS , T O O [65] short-term basis, to boot)—and yet accumulate our assets only in real dollars, eroded by the relentless rise in the cost of living that seems imbedded in our economy, the results are devastating. It is truly remarkable—and hardly praiseworthy—that this devastation is virtually ignored in the information that fund managers provide to fund investors. A paradox: While the index fund is remarkably taxe fficient in managing capital gains, it turns out to be relatively tax-inefficient in distributing dividend income. Why? Because its rock-bottom costs mean that nearly all the dividends paid on the stocks held by the low-cost index fund actually flow directly into the hands of the index fund’s shareholders. With the high expense ratios incurred by managed funds, however, only a tiny portion of the dividends that the funds receive actually find their way into the hands of the fund’s shareholders. Here is the unsurprising and ever relentless arithmetic: the annual gross dividend yield earned by the typical active equity fund before deducting fund expenses is about the same as the dividend yield of the low-cost index fund—1.8 percent in late-2006. But after deducting the 1.5 percent of expenses borne by the typical active fund, its net dividend yield drops to just 0.3 percent (!) for its owners. Fund operating costs and fees confiscate fully 80 percent of its dividend income, a sad reaffirmation of the eternal position of fund investors at the bottom of the mutual fund food chain. [66] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING The expense ratio of a low-cost index fund is about 0.15 percent, consuming only 8 percent of its 1.8 percent dividend yield. The result: a net yield of 1.65 percent to distribute to the passively managed index fund owners, a dividend merely 5.5 times as high as the dividend yield of 0.3 percent on the actively managed fund. For taxable shareholders, that larger dividend is subject to the current 15 percent federal tax on dividend income, consuming about 0.27 percentage points of the yield. Paradoxically, the active fund, with an effective tax rate of just 0.045 percent (15 percent of the 0.3 percent net yield), appears more tax efficient from a dividend standpoint. But the reality is that the tax imposed by the active managers in the form of the fees it deducts before paying those dividends has already consumed 80 percent of the yield. The wise investor will seek the dividend “tax-inefficiency” of the index fund dividend rather than the “tax-efficiency” of most actively managed funds engendered by their confiscatory operating costs. Don’t Take My Word for It Consider these words from a paper by John B. Shoven, of Stanford University and the National Bureau of Economic Research, and Joel M. Dickson, (continued) TA X E S A R E C O S TS , T O O [67] then of the Federal Reserve System: “Mutual funds have failed to manage their realized capital gains in such a way as to permit a substantial deferral of taxes (raising) investors’ tax bills considerably. . . . If the Vanguard 500 Index Fund could have deferred all of its realized capital gains, it would have ended up in the 91.8 percentile for the high tax investor” (i.e., it outpaced 92 percent of all managed equity funds). Or listen to investment adviser William Bernstein, author of The Four Pillars of Investing: “While it is probably a poor idea to own actively managed mutual funds in general, it is truly a terrible idea to own them in taxable accounts . . . (taxes are) a drag on performance of up to 4 percentage points each year . . . many index funds allow your capital gains to grow largely undisturbed until you sell. . . . For the taxable investor, indexing means never having to say you’re sorry.” And Dr. Malkiel again casts his lot with the index fund: “Index funds are . . . tax friendly, allowing investors to defer the realization of capital gains or avoid them completely if the shares are later bequeathed. To the extent that the long-run uptrend in stock prices continues, switching from security to security involves realizing capital gains that are subject to tax. Taxes are a crucially important financial consideration because the earlier realization of capital gains will substantially reduce net returns. Index funds do not trade from security to security and, thus, they tend to avoid capital gains taxes.” C te r Se v e n hap When the Good Times No Longer Roll  What Happens If Future Returns Are Lo wer?
