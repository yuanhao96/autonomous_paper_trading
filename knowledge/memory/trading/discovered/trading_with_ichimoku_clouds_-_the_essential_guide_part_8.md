becoming a hWlter, you must analyze before trading, otllerwise success will get further and further away. An analyst observes lhe instrument pa.tiently wltil an opportunity is seen. Once an opportunity is present, a plan is executed. The plan consists of entry criteria, money management, and so forth. Figure 1.2 is an example of a good trading plan. A true trader will not play a "probability game" but instead wait for the market to "show" him or her the opportunity through patience and discipline. Someone once told me "Trading i s neither logical nor predictable." Af­ ter years of trading, I can honestly say that statement is completely true.

It takes all the emotions and decision-making process completely out so someone just has to follow the trading plan and play the odds.
