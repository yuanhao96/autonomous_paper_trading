Chapter 3). The only difference is the that the Shooting Star has a small body and the Gravestone Doji, being a Doji, has no body. Some Japanese sources claim that the Gravestone Doji can occur only on the ground, not in the air. This means it can be a bull- Figure 2-9 䊏 18 Chapter Two ish indication on the ground or at a market low, not as good as a bearish one. It certainly portrays a sense of indecision and a possible change in trend. Dragonfly Doji (tonbo) The Dragonfly Doji, or Tonbo (pronounced Tombo), occurs when the open and close are at the high of the day (Figure 2-10). Like other Doji days, this one normally appears at market turning points. You will see in later chapters that this Doji is a special case of the Hanging Man and Hammer lines. A Tonbo line with a very long lower shadow (tail) (shitahigi) is also called a Takuri line. A Takuri line at the end of a down trend is extremely bullish. Four Price Doji This rare Doji line occurs when all four price components are equal. That is, the open, high, low, and close are the same (Figure 2-11). This line could occur when a stock is very illiquid or the data source did not have any prices other than the close. Futures traders should not confuse this with a limit move. It is so rare that one should suspect data errors. However, it does represent complete and total uncertainty by traders in market direction.

Ideally, the gap should encompass the shadows, but this is not always necessary. A Star indicates some uncertainty in the marketplace. Stars are part of many candle patterns, primarily reversal patterns. Figure 2-12 PAPER UMBRELLA (KARAKASA) Many of these lines are also included in the next chapter on candle patterns. Like the previously mentioned candle lines, the Umbrella lines have strong reversal implications. There is strong similarity between the Dragonfly Doji and this candle line. Two of the Umbrella lines are called the Hammer and Hanging Man, depending upon their location in the trend of the market. Figure 2-13 䊏 20 Chapter Two CONCLUSION The single candle lines are essential to Japanese candlestick analysis. When they are used by themselves, and then in combinations with other candle lines, a complete psyche of the market unfolds. Much of the analysis of these lines and patterns is part of Sakata’s Method (
