Trading for a Living (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1993). See “Classical Chart Analysis” (pages 69–114). Schabacker, Richard W. Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits (1932) (London: Pearson Professional Limited, 1997). F O U R INDICATORS— FIVE BULLETS TO A CLIP Answer 24 1. B 2. C 3. D 4. A Give yourself a point for each correct answer. Both packages need to be fed fresh data and both can display charts and indicators, but that’s where their paths diverge. Toolboxes help analyze the data but leave trading decisions to you. Black boxes claim to liberate you from the onerous task of thinking, as they issue trading commands. Neither guarantees a profit, but at least with a toolbox, if you lose money, you can learn from your mistake instead of scapegoating the software. Answer 25 1. A 2. B 3. B 4. A 5. B 101 102 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Give yourself a point for each correct answer. There are many more oscillators than trend-following indicators. When you trade, it is important to choose a few indicators from each group and combine them in order to balance their messages. Answer 26 1. B 2. A 3. B 4. B 5. A Give yourself a point for each correct answer. The idea is to choose your favorite timeframe and then begin by analyzing the next higher one before returning to your favorite. Longer-term charts help identify bigger trends and make strategic decisions. Two timeframes are enough—you certainly never need more than three— making a weekly chart superfluous for day-traders. Rallies are bigger than declines in bull markets, and this applies to their duration as well as to their extent. Answer 27 1. D 2. A 3. B 4. E 5. C Give yourself a point for each correct answer. INDICATORS—FIVE BULLETS TO A CLIP 103 The slope of an MA shows whether bulls or bears are in control. The shorter an MA, the more “whippy” it gets. Position traders should average closing prices, but day-traders can average high, low, and close. Exponential moving averages, unlike simple ones, are not distorted by dropping off old data. A moving average shows the average consensus of value, and buying near the MA means buying value. Answer 28 1. I 2. A, L 3. E, G, H, J 4. D, F, K 5. M 6. B 7. B-C Give yourself a point for each correct answer (half a point if you missed one of several occurrences). Add two points if you got the bonus question right, or a point for getting it partly right. Upturns and downturns of a moving average identify trend changes; these are the most important messages of an MA. Buying at a rising EMA (exponential moving average) means buying value, whereas chasing rallies leads to greater fool theory trades—overpaying and hoping that a greater fool will pay even more down the road. The letter L identifies a downtrend. Shorting in area M means shorting value, expecting to cover below value. The kangaroo tail B serves as the first low of a double bottom; prices try to grind down into that area but fail, and a strong rally ensues. At the right edge—bearish. The trend is down, identified by the EMA, which is pushing lower. The shorting signal M is still in effect. Keep a stop above the previous week’s high because if prices rise above it they will complete a minor double bottom, including a false downside breakout, and the EMA will turn up. 104 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Answer 29 1. E 2. A 3. C 4. D 5. B Give yourself a point for each correct answer. The upper channel line reflects the normal limits of market optimism, the lower line the normal limits of market pessimism. In uptrends, the envelope hugs rally peaks, while lows may not reach the lower channel line; in downtrends, the lows touch an envelope, while the highs may not reach it. The longer the timeframe, the wider the envelope; the weekly envelope is about twice as wide as the daily in the same market. A well-drawn envelope contains about 95% of recent market data, while Bollinger bands expand and contract with market volatility. Answer 30 1. C, E, F 2. D, G 3. A, H, I, K 4. B, J Give yourself a point for each correct answer (half a point if you missed one of several occurrences). Add two points if you got the bonus question right, or a point for getting it partly right. The time to buy is when the trend is up, identified by a rising moving average. Buying near the rising EMA is a value trade. When prices hit the upper channel line, they show that optimism is rampant, the market is overbought, and it is a good time to sell and take profits. Reverse the procedure in downtrends; when the EMA is down, short INDICATORS—FIVE BULLETS TO A CLIP 105 near its level and cover when pessimism is overdone, with prices hitting the lower channel line. At the right edge—bearish to neutral. The trend is down, prices have already touched their EMA, and are headed lower. If, within the next few days, there is a rally above 75, touching the EMA, you may get a chance to sell short and then look to cover near the lower channel line. If not, stand aside and continue to monitor the stock. The downtrend is getting a little long in the tooth, and you should be alert to the flattening of the EMA; when it turns up, it will give a strong buy signal. Answer 31 1. B (27%) 2. C (14%) 3. D (−25%—loss) 4. A (39%) Give yourself a point for each correct answer. Measure the height of a channel from the upper to the lower channel line. If you take 30% of that distance or more out of a trade, it is an A trade; 20% or better earns you a B; 10% or better a C; and anything lower, including a loss, a D. A trade is not complete until you have rated your performance on this scale. Answer 32 1. D 2. E 3. A 4. C 5. B Give yourself a point for each correct answer. 106 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES MACD-lines is the primary indicator, and MACD-Histogram is derived from it, tracking the distance between the two lines
