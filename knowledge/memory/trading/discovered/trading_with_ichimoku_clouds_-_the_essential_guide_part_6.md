cmnpanies have pulled 'it off before. It's an easy way for high-g1'Owth compa:nies to de/a,y l'ecording costs, says HOWQ,rd Schiht, president of lhe Centerfol' Fina, ndal Resem'ch & Anal.ysis. For insla,nce, America Online paid a $3.5 m'illionjine to the Se­ 'italized the costs of ma ,iring out thousands of trial. diskettes in lhe curil'ies and Exchange Commission 'in 2000 to settle charges it cap­ rnid-'90s. 77w SEC found that by not charging the expense right a/way, AOL 1'eported a profit instead oj a 10ssJor Ihme year·s. AOL sa.ys it stopped capitalizing lhe costs in Oclober 1996 bemuse it changed its busi­ ness model. "77t'is was completely differe nt, as AOL's accounting was alwaysJully disclosed and AOL did not admit any wrongdoing 'in its settlement agl'Cement," sa,ys spokeswoman Ann Brackbill.. Any company in Q,ny industry can use lhe lo,ctic. We have discussed fundamentaJ analysis for stocks but are the cur­ rencies the same? How do you now apply fundamental analysis to trading currencies? In order to answer this question, central bank policies need to be discussed. First, Ulere is hawkish (which is a bias toward raising inter­ est rates). A bank can do this to stop inflation, to reduce money supply, and so forth. Normally if the future of a currency has higher interest rates, then the value of that currency should increase. Next, there is a central bank policy that is dovish (which is bias toward lowering interest rates). This policy is used to increase money supply, help stimulate an economy, and so forth. If you can find a currency pair with one COlUltry being dovish and another being hawkish then you have a great currency trade from a fWldamental viewpoint. For example, in Ule past few years, Ule Japanese yen (Japan had a Zero Interest Rate Policy) versus almost any currency. If you have ever heard of Ule famous concept "carry trade," it is dealing with the Japanese yen and other currency pairs. Since the financial market meltdown, the United States has had a policy of keeping rates under 1 per­ cent for an extended period of time. As a result, the U.S. dollar is a carry trade with the Japanese yen and has subsequently led to a decline i n the U.S. dollar. So far, fWlClamental analysis for stocks and currencies has been dis­ cussed and it is apparent that you have to know a lot of information in order to trade stocks and currencies with this approach. How do Ule other instruments such as commodity futures (Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Feeder Cattle, and so forth) fare with fundamental analysis? If you are trading all Introduction xv these instruments, you have to have a "global" view of everything that is going on in the world in order to trade. Some traders have taken the time to leam, especially with the Intemet; however, for many people that is vir­ tually impossible. The main goal of this book is to simplify trading. All the fundamental aspects of each instrument and market will be built into price. Therefore, we are only going to rely
