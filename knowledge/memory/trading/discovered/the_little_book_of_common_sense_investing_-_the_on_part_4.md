Chapter 4, to enormous superiority over time. It is hard to imagine that even a single one of the large-cap core equity funds has a similar record of consistency. Consistency matters. A fund that is good or very good in the vast majority of years produces a far larger longterm return than a fund that is superb in half the years and a disaster in the remaining half. Single-year rankings, C A S T Y O U R L OT W I T H B U S I N E S S [31] then, ignore the sheer arithmetic advantage of that consistency. In the next chapter, the impact of that long-term consistency is catalogued over the past 25 years. These annual data are what we call survivor-biased; they exclude the records of the inevitably poorer performing funds that regularly go out of business. As a result of this noise in the data, the chart further understates the success of the market-owning index strategy. Much criticism has been heaped on the S&P 500 for often picking “new economy” stocks such as JDS Uniphase and Yahoo! near their inflated peak prices during the bubble, just before they crashed, thereby taking on a growth bias at exactly the wrong time. While the criticism is valid, the excellent long-term record of the flawed Index belies the existence of a significant problem. In fact, since the market peaked early in 2000 (as shown in Exhibit 3.3), the S&P 500 has had only a single significantly subpar year (2000), three years at about par, and three years (2003, 2004, and 2006) in the top quartile of its peers. I imagine that the vast majority of money managers would have been ecstatic with such an outcome.  The record of the first index mutual fund: $15,000 invested in 1976; value in 2006, $461,771. [32] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING Thus, the recent era not only has failed to erode, but has nicely enhanced the lifetime record of the world’s first index fund—now known as Vanguard 500 Index Fund. Let me be specific: at a dinner on September 20, 2006, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the fund’s initial public offering, the counsel for the fund’s underwriters reported that he had purchased 1,000 shares at the original offering price of $15.00 per share—a $15,000 investment. He proudly announced that the value of his holding that evening (including shares acquired through reinvesting the fund’s dividends and distributions over the years) was $461,771. Now, there’s a number that requires no comment.* This cumulative long-term winning record confirms that owning American business through a broadly diversified index fund is not only logical but, to say the least, incredibly productive. Equally important, it is consistent with the age-old principle expressed by Sir William of Occam: instead of joining the crowd of investors who dabble in complex machinations to pick stocks and try to outguess the stock market (two inevitably fruitless tasks for investors in the aggregate), choose the simplest of all solutions—buy and hold the market portfolio. *Well, maybe one comment. Of the 360 equity mutual funds then in existence, only 211 remain. C A S T Y O U R L OT W I T H B U S I N E S S Don’t Take My Word for It Hear David Swensen, widely respected chief investment officer of the Yale University Endowment Fund. “A minuscule 4 percent of funds produce market-beating after-tax results with a scant 0.6 percent (annual) margin of gain. The 96 percent of funds that fail to meet or beat the Vanguard 500 Index Fund lose by a wealth-destroying margin of 4.8 percent per annum.” The simple index fund solution has been adopted as a cornerstone of investment strategy for many of the nation’s pension plans operated by our giant corporations and state and local governments. Indexing is also the predominant strategy for the largest of them all, the retirement plan for federal government employees, the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). The plan has been a remarkable success, and now holds some $173 billion of assets for the benefit of our public servants and members of armed services. All contributions and earnings are tax-deferred until withdrawal, much like the corporate 401(k) thrift plans. (Overcoming what must have been some serious reservations, even the Bush administration determined to follow the TSP model in its plan for Personal Savings Accounts as an optional alternative to our Social Security program.) (continued) [33] [34] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING Indexing is also praised across the Atlantic “pond.” Listen to these words from Jonathan Davis, columnist for London’s The Spectator: “Nothing highlights better the continuing gap between rhetoric and substance in British financial services than the failure of providers here to emulate Jack Bogle’s index fund success in the United States. Every professional in the City knows that index funds should be core building blocks in any long-term investor’s portfolio. Since 1976, the Vanguard index fund has produced a compound annual return of 12 percent, better than threequarters of its peer group. Yet even 30 years on, ignorance and professional omerta still stand in the way of more investors enjoying the fruits of this unsung hero of the investment world.” ap Ch t e r F ou r How Most Investors Turn a Winner’s Game into a Loser’s Game  “The Relentless Rules of Humble Arithmetic” BEFORE WE TURN TO the success of indexing as an investment strategy, let’s explore in a bit more depth just why it is that investors as a group fail to earn the returns that our corporations generate through their dividends and earnings growth, ultimately reflected in the prices of their stocks. To understand why they do not, we need only to recognize the simple mathematics of investing: All investors as a group must necessarily earn precisely the market return, but only before the costs o f investing are deducted.
