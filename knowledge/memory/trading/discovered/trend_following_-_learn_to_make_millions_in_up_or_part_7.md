Chapter 1 • Trend Following prey, a trend follower can wait weeks or months for the right trade that puts the odds on his side. Additionally, and ideally, traders go short as often as they go long, enabling them to make money in both up and down markets. However, a majority of traders won’t or can’t go short. They struggle with the concept of making money when a market declines. I hope that after reading Trend Following, the confusion and hesitation associated with making money in down markets, markets that are dropping or crashing, will dissipate. 7 Trend followers are traders, so I generally use the word “trader” instead of “investor” throughout. Fundamental Versus Technical There are two basic theories that are used to trade in the markets. The first theory is fundamental analysis. It is the study of external factors that affect the supply and demand of a particular market. Fundamental analysis uses factors such as weather, government policy, domestic and foreign political and economic events, price-earnings ratios, and balance sheets to make buy and sell decisions. By monitoring “fundamentals” for a particular market, one can supposedly predict a change in market direction before that change has been reflected in the price of the market with the belief that you can then make money from that knowledge. The vast majority of Wall Street uses fundamental analysis alone. They are the academics, brokers, and analysts who spoke highly of the new economy during the dot-com craze. These same Wall Street players brought millions of players into the real estate and credit bubbles of 2008. Millions bought into their rosy fundamental projections and rode bubbles straight up with no clue how to exit when those bubbles finally burst. Consider an exchange between a questioner and President Bush at a December 17, 2007 press conference: Q: “I wanted to ask you [Mr. President]—I’m a financial advisor here in Fredericksburg [Virginia], and I wanted to ask you what your thoughts are on the market going forward for ’08, and if any of your policies would make any difference?” The President: “No (laughter), I’m not going to answer your question. If I were an investor, I would be looking at the basic fundamentals of the economy. Early on in my Whenever we get a period of poor performance, most investors conclude something must be fixed. They ask if the markets have changed. But trend following presupposes change. John W. Henry7 8 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets presidency, somebody asked me about the stock market, and I thought I was a financial genius, and it was a mistake (laughter). The fundamentals of this nation are strong. One of the interesting developments has been the role of exports in overall GDP growth. When you open up markets for goods and services, and we’re treated fairly, we can compete just about with anybody, anywhere. And exports have been an integral part, at least of the 3rd quarter growth. But far be it for me—I apologize—for not being in the position to answer your question. But I don’t think you want your President opining on whether the Dow Jones is going to—(laughter)—be going up or down.” One of our basic philosophical tendencies is that change is constant, change is random, and trends will reappear if we go through a period of non-trending markets. It’s only a precursor to future trends and we feel if there is an extended period of nontrending markets, this really does set up a base for very dynamic trends in the future. Former Head of Research at John W. Henry8 The President’s view is a typical fundamental view shared by the vast majority of market participants. Consider further an excerpt found in Yahoo! Finance’s commentary; it outlines a single market day: “It started off decent, but ended up the fourth straight down day for stocks…early on, the indices were in the green, mostly as a continuation from the bounce Monday afternoon…but as the day wore on and the markets failed to show any upward momentum, the breakdown finally occurred…The impetus this time was attributed to the weakness in the dollar, even though the dollar was down early in the day while stocks were up…also, oil prices popped higher on wishful thinking statements from a Venezuelan official about OPEC cutting production… whether or not these factors were simply excuses for selling, or truly perceived as fundamental factors hardly matters….” Millions of readers read this type of drivel every day. Worse, thousands watch Jim Cramer of Mad Money fame promote similar nonsensical beliefs every day. Predictions based off of fundamental analysis don’t work for the vast majority of market participants. Great example? Not many predicted the October/November 2008 market crash! On top of not being able to predict, fundamental analysis leaves many with trying to pick bottoms or trust that conditions will always improve. One of the great traders of the twentieth century, Ed Seykota, nailed the problem with fundamental analysis:
