Chapter 4, the net returns earned by these investors must of necessity fall short of those aggregate gross returns by the amount of intermediation costs they incur. Our common sense tells us the obvious; while owning the stock market over the long term is a winner’s game, beating the stock market is a loser’s game.  If the data do not prove that indexing wins, well, the data are wrong. Such an all-market fund is guaranteed to outpace over time the returns earned by equity investors as a group. Once you recognize this fact, you can see that the index fund is guaranteed to win not only over time, but every year, and every month and week, even every minute of the day. Because no matter how long or short the time frame, the gross return in the stock market, minus intermediation costs, equals the net return earned by investors as a C A S T Y O U R L OT W I T H B U S I N E S S [29] group. If the data do not prove that indexing wins, well, the data are wrong. Over the short term, however, it doesn’t always look as if the S&P 500 (still the most common basis of comparison for mutual funds and pension plans) or the Total Stock Market Index is winning. That is because there is no possible way to calculate the returns earned by the millions of diverse participants, amateur and professional alike, Americans and foreign investors, in the U.S. stock market. So what we do in the mutual fund field is calculate the returns of the various funds, counting each fund— instead of each fund’s assets—as one entry. Since there are many small-cap and mid-cap funds, usually with relatively modest asset bases, they make a disproportionate impact on the data. When small- and midcap funds are leading the total market, the all-market index fund seems to lag. When small- and midcap stocks are lagging the market, the index fund looks formidable indeed. Nonetheless, the exercise of calculating how the returns earned by the stock market compare with returns earned by the average equity fund is both illuminating and persuasive (Exhibit 3.3). If we compare the results of what are described as “large-cap core” funds with the returns of the S&P 500 (because of its market capitalization weightings, a “large-cap core” index), the advantage of the S&P Index is impressive.

The Index has outpaced the average fund in 26 of the remaining 35 years, including 11 of the past 15 years. Its average ranking was in the 58th percentile (outperforming 58 percent of the comparable actively managed funds), leading, as we will show in
