CHAPTER 1 SO YOU WANT TO TRADE FOREX? 3 Many traders who fail tend to blame the market or other external factors. It is everyone else’s fault but theirs. Believe it or not, this is how history repeats itself in their lives. If this describes you, then this book can really help you make a change in your life. Not only does it teach the technical side of trading, but also it will force you to address some of those unproductive bad habits. When trading Forex, your daily actions will be based on a clear productive mindset of: Reappointment versus disappointment Resilience versus resentment Better versus bitter A winner not a whiner A star not a scar A victor not a victim A conquerer not a crumbler The reality in life is that the choice is yours. Bad things happen to everyone, and you won’t be spared as you learn to trade Forex. Your success will be determined by how confident you feel, what you think, and how you respond when bad things do happen. In any financial or business endeavor, success starts in your head, is fueled by your heart, and the results are driven by your actions. These will determine your Forex experience. In this book, you will learn certain disciplines and habits that will help you become a better trader. There are three questions you have to ask yourself before you trade: 1. 2. 3. Do I want to make a lot of money? Do I want to make an average income? Do I just want to get by and break even? You need to understand these things about yourself because the market tends to be self-fulfilling. Remember, you will always find what you are looking for, whether it be good or bad. Nothing in life is perfect, and if you set yourself up with an unrealistic expectation that things should be perfect, you put yourself in a position to focus only on negative events. If you bring this perspective to the trading table, it will have a similarly destructive effect. Uncover who you are and what you are looking for before you trade so that you can lay the proper foundation on which to build your trading career. 4 THE 10 ESSENTIALS OF FOREX TRADING FOLLOW THE RULES The first step to successful trading is to analyze your character to ensure you are not bringing your bad habits to the trading table. Your moral constitution, work ethic, and personal beliefs will mirror your trading habits. If you are a rule breaker, then there is no point in trying to learn a new successful skill that requires rules to be followed. If it is in your character to break rules, then learning a new successful skill that can change your financial future is useless. You will simply break the rules and self-destruct. I know a person who is habitually late to work. Despite the fact that his employer requires him to arrive on time, he doesn’t seem to believe that showing up on time is that important, which is why he has had to change jobs four times in the past year. As a result of his tardiness, he is repeatedly terminated. Yet he refuses to change his behavior. He is more willing to go through the trouble of searching for a new job than he is to change a simple, yet critical, destructive personal habit. What I find with most unsuccessful people is that they fail to see the importance of following rules that will lead to their success, such as showing up on time. The truth is, changing little unproductive habits makes a huge difference to one’s success. People underestimate how important preparation is for success. However, the reason they get locked into poverty and mediocrity—only getting by—is that they show up to the battlefield totally unprepared and unprotected. Their focus quickly turns from the cause they were fighting for to survival and self-preservation. “I didn’t bring the proper armor to fight this war, I didn’t think I’d be here this long, I don’t have enough food to survive, I don’t have enough ammunition,” and so forth. With that survival mentality, one’s attitude turns from that of a conquerer to that of a crumbler. To survive the coming learning curve and successfully transition to a productive career trading on Forex, you will need to properly arm yourself. Creating your personal constitution is like acquiring the best helmet possible to protect your most important asset—your mind. Your mind is the epicenter of your body and the control tower of your destiny. You first need to identify, and perhaps define, who you truly are. The following exercise will help you discover your personal constitution. Once you have completed this exercise, you will be able to see what you need to change in your personal life to become a successful trader. This exercise is what I call a litmus test. (A Litmus test commonly refers to a
