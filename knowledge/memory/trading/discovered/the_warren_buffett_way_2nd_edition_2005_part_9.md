Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 1999. The company’s shares sank even lower, and by October 2001 were down to $0.23. So why would Warren Buffett be interested? Two reasons: a very strong brand that offered growth potential under the right management, and the arrival of a man on a white horse. John B. Holland had been a highly respected executive with Fruit of the Loom for more than twenty years, including several years as president and CEO, when he retired in 1996. In 2000, he was brought back as executive vice-president charged with revamping operations. Holland represents a perfect example of the management qualities Buffett insists upon. Although publicly he remained largely silent about Farley, beyond a brief reference to “poor management,” Buffett has made no secret of his disdain for executives who bully their boards into sweet compensation deals, and boards that allow it. In contrast, he is enthusiastically vocal about his admiration for Holland. (Continued) 87 He explained his thinking to Berkshire shareholders: “John Holland was responsible for Fruit’s operations in its most bountiful years. . . . [After the bankruptcy] John was rehired, and he undertook a major reworking of operations. Before John’s return, deliveries were chaotic, costs soared, and relations with key customers deteriorated. . . . He’s been restoring the old Fruit of the Loom, albeit in a much more competitive environment. [In our purchase offer] we insisted on a very unusual proviso: John had to be available to continue serving as CEO after we took over. To us, John and the brand are Fruit’s key assets.”7 Since Holland took the reins, Fruit of the Loom has undergone a massive restructuring to lower its costs. It slashed its freight costs, reduced overtime, and trimmed inventory levels. It disposed of sideline businesses, eliminated unprofitable product lines, found new efficiencies in manufacturing process, and worked to restore customer satisfaction by filling orders on time. Almost immediately, improvement was apparent. Earnings increased, operating expenses decreased. In 2000, gross earnings rose by $160.3 million—a 222 percent increase—compared to 1999, and gross margin increased 11 percentage points. The company reported an operating loss in 2000 of $44.2 million, compared to the 1999 loss of $292.3 million. Even more revealing of improvement are the fourth-quarter results—an operating loss of $13.5 million (which included one-time consolidation costs related to the closure of four U.S. plants) in 2000, compared to $218.6 million—more than sixteen times greater—just one year earlier. In 2001, the positive trend continued. Gross earnings grew another $72.5 million, a 31 percent increase over 2000, and gross margin increased 7.7 percentage points to 22.7 percent for the year. That means the company ended 2001 with operating earnings of $70.1 million, compared to 2000’s $44.2 million loss. Of course monumental problems such as the company faced are not fully corrected overnight, and Fruit of the Loom must still operate in a ferociously competitive industry environment, but so far Buffett is pleased with the company’s performance. 88 I n v e s t i n g G u i d e l i n e s : M a n a g e m e n t Te n e t s 89 Lest anyone still consider buying a debt-ridden bankrupt company a surprising move, there was also a third reason for Buffett’s decision, which should come as no surprise whatsoever: He was able to acquire the company on very favorable financial terms.
