any stock at a PIE of 10 or less could be purchased. One of the key things I look at is the 10 PIE ratio level on a chart. If you see a PIE ratio of 10, normally you see technical support in that particular stock. Other variations that may be used are stocks at a PIE level of to or less as well as Cash to Short Term CST) Liability's level of50 percent. This would indicate the stock is trading at a low eamings multiple. The stock is well funded in temlS of its debt exposure, All of this obviously has nothing to do with technicals or charting-it's financial company analysis. But when overlying these stocks onto a chart you may be able to apply support levels to this fundamental analysis. Today, if you listen to the news, you will see that many companies pro­ vide many revisions to their numbers and also many companies are "cook­ ing the books." They manipulate numbers before earnings aIlIlOWlcements just to drive the stock price higher. Based on these manipulated values, fun­ damentalists will buy/sell the stock lithe truth comes out, their invesbnent will be destroyed completely. In the last couple of years, many companies trust the results if this is happening more and more often? Let us say that a have been getting in trouble based on "accounting practices." How can you company is not manipulating the numbers and they announce a good quar­ ter, why does a stock go down when they beat estimates and have good fundamental values? Why will some instruments move more than 20 per­ cent faster than their earnings percentage groWtJl? There is no direct an­ swer to these questions. Everything depends on speculation, which is not predictable.
