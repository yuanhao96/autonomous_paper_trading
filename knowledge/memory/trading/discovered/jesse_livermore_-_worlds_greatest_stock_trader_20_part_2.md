a lot more to Livermore’s story. The published record revealed almost nothing about the real Jesse Livermore. I embarked on a two-year journey that would take me into Livermore’s world—both professional and personal. I was able to interview Paul Livermore, Jesse’s surviving son, who spoke for the record for the first time about his father. I also spoke to Patricia Livermore, the wife of Jesse Livermore Junior and close confidant of Dorothy Livermore, Livermore’s second wife and the mother of his two children. Just like the famous financier J.P. Morgan, Livermore suffered from great bouts of depression throughout his life. In the period he lived there were no remedies for this condition, and finally, in 1940, he ended his life by his own hand. Livermore was quiet and secretive, yet lived a very opulent and exciting life, moving in the highest social circles. He was personally blamed for the great crash of 1929, and received numerous death and kidnapping threats. He married a beautiful Ziegfeld Follies showgirl and fathered two children, one of whom would eventually be shot by his own mother. This book is a complete biography of Jesse Livermore, the man and the trader. It chronicles his life in fine detail and also reveals many new aspects of his groundbreaking trading techniques, which were revolutionary then and which remain revolutionary today. There are four simple themes to this book. First, human nature never changes. Therefore, the stock market never changes.

It is our human emotions that drive the market, as they do most other things on this planet. Second, the achievement of material goals and career ambitions does not equal the achievement of happiness in life. There is no correlation between success and happiness. There is no automatic balance between worldly riches and emotional fulfillment. Third, it is our will that allows each of us to accomplish our goals, not our intellect. Talent is not enough. Luck is not enough. Only the will to suffer hard work and incredible persistence leads to the attainment of the impossible. There are no shortcuts; there is no easy way. Especially, as you’ll find out, in the stock market. Finally, it is the individual, not the group, that has led to the great discoveries of humanity. The great ideas, the great fortunes, and the giant steps forward in technology, politics, and medicine have all come from individuals, not groups. There are many ways to play the market, hundreds of theories, techniques, systems, and strategies. This book covers Livermore’s approach. It reveals for the first time in one volume his secrets on how to successfully speculate and make money. A great deal of the research conducted on Livermore’s
