vessel will see the ship roll violently, whereas a small wave would have little or no effect. 3.The Law of Effort vs Result This is Wyckoff's third law which is similar to Newton's third law of physics. Every action must have an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, the price action on the chart must reflect the volume action below. The two should always be in harmony with one another, with the effort ( which is the volume ) seen as the result ( which is the consequent price action ). This is where, as Wyckoff taught, we start to analyse each price bar, using a ‘forensic approach’, to discover whether this law has been maintained. If it has, then the market is behaving as it should, and we can continue our analysis on the following bar. If not, and there is an anomaly, then we need to discover why, and just like a crime scene investigator, establish the reasons. The Ticker described Wycoff's approach perfectly. Throughout his twenty years of studying the markets, and talking to other great traders such as Jesse Livermore and J P Morgan, he had become one of the leading exponents of tape reading, and which subsequently formed the basis of his methodology and analysis. In 1910, he wrote what is still considered to be the most authoritative book on tape reading entitled, Studies in Tape Reading, not published under his own name, but using the pseudonym Rollo Tape! Livermore too was an arch exponent of tape reading, and is another of the all time legends of Wall Street. He began his trading career when he was 15, working as a quotation board boy, calling out the latest prices from the ticker tape. These were then posted on the boards in the brokerage office of Paine and Webber where he worked. Whilst the job itself was boring, the young Jesse soon began to realise that the constant stream of prices, coupled with buy and sell orders was actually revealing a story. The tape was talking to him, and revealing the inner most secrets of the market. He began to notice that when a stock price behaved in a certain way with the buying and selling, then a significant price move was on the way. Armed with this knowledge, Livermore left the brokerage office and began to trade full time, using his intimate knowledge of the ticker tape. Within 2 years he had turned $1000 into $20,000, a huge sum in those days, and by the time he was 21, this had become, $200,000, earning him the nickname of the 'Boy Plunger' From stocks he moved into commodities, where even larger sums followed, and despite a roller coaster ride, where he made and lost several million dollars, his fame was cemented in history with his short selling in two major market crashes. The first was in 1907, where he made over $3 million dollars. However, this gain was dwarfed in the Wall Street crash of 1929, where conservative estimates suggest he made around $100 million dollars. Whilst others suffered and lost everything, Jesse Livermore prospered, and at the time was vilified in the press and
