CHAPTER 1 SO YOU WANT TO TRADE FOREX? 15 takes to do the right thing, because it aligns with who they are. They have their priorities in check and have the right perspective and attitude when it comes to facing the internal battle between the two wolves that exists in all of us. Your personal constitution will mirror your trading results. CONCLUSION Take the time to answer honestly the previous constitution-based questions to allow you to build a solid foundation for your long-term success in trading. You have an obligation to your personal future, happiness, health, family, and income to establish a solid personal constitution. Developing a solid personal and trading constitution is the first step of your journey toward successful trading on Forex. I started this book on trading by pointing out the importance of creating an emotional and psychological constitution before teaching you any technical skills. What good does it do to teach you technical skills if you do not have the courage to execute them? Why teach you trading rules if you are a rule breaker? There is no point to teaching you how to take advantage of new trading opportunities if you cannot let go of your past mistakes and failures. Developing a solid personal and trading constitution will be the first step of your journey toward finding your rightful pot of gold in trading. I look forward to accompanying you on your journey to the end of your trading rainbow. Let our journey begin… . This page intentionally left blank C H A 2 P T E R INTRODUCTION TO THE FOREX WILL NEVER FORGET one trip to Australia, back in early 2001. I was working out of our office in Sydney, preparing for a class, when I was e-mailed the list of attendees. The registrar told me there were 26 Australians signed up for the class and one Scotsman, named Ian, who had a very strong Scottish accent. The next morning I started class the way I always do, asking everyone their names, their current occupations, why they want to learn trading on the Forex, and, more importantly, why they chose to get involved with my company, Market Traders Institute, versus another. We started going around the room introducing ourselves and eventually came to Ian. Ian was an older fellow, perhaps in his late fifties, and in great physical shape. “Hel-ow chief,” he said in an extremely strong Scottish accent. “My name is Ian, and I am from Scotland. I just happened to be here in Australia for a bit when your advertisements caught my interest. I called your office and they told me all about you, so I came here because I was told you could teach me how to trade on the Forex and make money. Is that true?” I confidently answered, “I will do my best, Ian.” He said, “That’s not what I asked. Now pay attention to the question. Can you teach me how to trade on the Forex and make money?” I 17 Copyright © 2007 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Do you know what that is?” “Ian, I have learned never to assume anything. The term ‘mercenary’ here in Australia could be different, so why don’t you inform the class what you mean.” I was absolutely not prepared for what he said next. “Chief, I kill people for foreign governments, and I am here to tell you that if this is a scam and if you can’t teach me how to trade on the Forex . . . I will kill you.” There is nothing worse than being caught off-guard or put on the spot in front of a crowd. Everyone’s eyes in the class were now focused on me. So I threw my hands up in the air and said, “Wow, no pressure, Ian.” Then I looked at the class and said, “Class, I know we have only scheduled three days of training, but we may be here for a month because I am going to go over each and every single detail I know about the Forex. This will be the best class I have ever given, and, rest assured, if I don’t know the answer to a question, I will go to the ends of the earth to answer it before I leave Australia, because I don’t want to have to look over my shoulder the rest of my life wondering if Ian is near.” The class burst into loud laughter. The best way to learn something and remember it is to teach it to someone else, so after I teach a concept for about 45 minutes, I instruct the class to teach each other. I have the person on the right teach the concept to the person on their left, and after they are done I have the person on the left teach the concept to the person on their right. Little did I realize this teaching technique would potentially save my life. When I divided the class into pairs that day, I believe God protected me by having an odd number of students. When I got to Ian, I said, “Ian, I will be your partner.” Although some of the other students asked to partner with me, I told them, “Nothing personal, but my life is at stake here, so I am going to work with Ian.” Thankfully, they all understood. Looking back, I must say that was one of the most detailed, and perhaps one of the best, classes I have ever given. Every time someone had a question, I immediately asked, “Ian did you understand the question?” Then I would follow up with, “Ian, did you understand the answer?” If he said yes,
