GENIUS FAILED new options, new bonds to trade, just managers were waking up and wanting the end of the .97os, firms such as Salomon were bonds in ways that Homer had never dreamed of: together, for instance, and distilling them into there were new instruments, professional portfolio when to trade them. By slicing dicing and mortgages blending bite-sized, easily chewable securities. big change was the computer. As late as the end of the t96os , whenever traders wanted to price a bond, they would look it up in a thick blue book. In \177969, Salomon hired a mathematician, Martin Leibowitz, who got Salomon's first computer. Leibowitz became the most popular mathematician in history, or so it seemed when the bond market was hot and Salomon's traders, who no longer had time to page through the blue book, crowded around him to get bond prices that they now needed on the double. By the early \17797os, traders had their own crude handheld calculators, which subtly quickened the rhythm of the bond markets. Meriwether, who joined Salomon on the financing desk, known as the Repo Department, got there just as the bond world was turning topsy-turvy. Once predictable and relatively low risk, the bond world was pulsating with change and opportunity, especially for younger, sharp-eyed analysts. Meriwether, who didn't know a soul when he arrived in New York, rented a room at a Manhattan athletic club and soon discovered that bonds were made for him. Bonds have a particular appeal to mathematical types becauseso much of what determines their value is readily quantifiable. Essentially, two factors dictate a bond's price.One can be gleaned from the coupon on the bond itself. If you can lend money at xo percent today, you would pay a premium for a bond that yielded x z percent. How much of a premium? That would depend on the maturity of the bond, the timing of the payments, your outlook (if you have one) for interest rates in the future, plus all manner of wrinkles devised by clever issuers, such as whether the bond is callable, convertible into equity, and so forth. The other factor is the risk of default. In most cases, that is not strictly quantifiable, nor is it very great. Still, it exists. General Electric is a good risk, but not as good as Uncle Sam.Hewlett-Packard is somewhat riskier than GE; Amazon.com,riskier still. Therefore, bond investors demand a higher interest rate when they lend to Amazon as compared with GE, or to Bolivia as compared with France. Deciding how much higher is the heart of bond trading, but the point The other MERIWETHER \2259 bonds trade on a mathematical spread. The riskier the bond, the spread--that is, the greater the differencebetween the yield on it and the yield on (virtually risk free) Treasurys.Generally, though not always, the spread also increaseswith time--that is, investors demand a slightly higher yield on a two-year note than on a thirty-day Hill because the uncertainty is greater. These rules are the catechism of bond
