internet. Everything was done manually, with hand drawn charts, and price reading from a paper tape. We are lucky. All this is now done for us, on an electronic chart. All we have to do is interpret the price volume relationship, and to do that you need a good teacher. I hope to be that teacher, and deliver the lessons in this book. However, how did I stumble on volume, and its symbiotic and interdependent relationship price? Well, it is a rather odd story, and in relating it, I hope it will become apparent, that even though it was hugely expensive, in hindsight I know I have been lucky, because I started my trading journey with volume. Many traders spend years trying different trading approaches, becoming increasingly disillusioned as each one fails to live up to the expectations of the marketing hype, before arriving at the same conclusion. It is only in hindsight I can appreciate how extremely fortunate I have been, and now I want to share this knowledge with you. So, if you are reading this book as a novice trader, then you too are lucky. You have avoided the pain and expense of a long, fruitless journey. If you are a seasoned trader, welcome to this book and I hope that it fulfils your expectations, and that you have enough enthusiasm left for reading just one more book about trading! In telling my story here, I have not changed any of the names, and many of these people are still involved in the trading world. How It All Started In the late 1990’s I couldn’t understand why my pension and investments did not reflect what was happening in the stock market, which was extremely bullish. In these dark days before the internet I could only rely on newspapers, and it was in January 1998 that I read an article in the Sunday Times about a trader who had made significant sums from trading, and was now looking for recruits to train in his methods. That trader’s name was Albert Labos. Two weeks later, on an early Sunday morning, I joined hundreds of other hopefuls in a packed room, on the HMS President. The President is a famous anti-submarine Q-ship completed in 1918 moored on the River Thames close to Blackfriars Bridge. I arrived, cheque book in hand, ready to sign up to whatever was on offer. The event was shrouded in mystery from the start. First, Albert exhorted the 'spies' in the room to leave. He knew who they were and why they were there, and as he told us later, these were spies from the major banks, come to learn his secret trading techniques. These were trading techniques which could take on the cartel, currently enjoyed by these market makers. We were then introduced to a Tom Williams. We were told that Tom was partially sighted, and I can’t quite remember if he had a white cane. We were also told that Tom was an ex ‘syndicate trader’. However, to this day I am not entirely certain what a ‘syndicate trader’ is or does. But at the time it sounded very impressive. Various charts were presented during the pitch and all the while Albert
