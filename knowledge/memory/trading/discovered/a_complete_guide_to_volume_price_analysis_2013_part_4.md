gun and bought too early do you think? Regards Alex Foreward This is the best of times for those willing to study, learn quickly, work hard … learn from the past to succeed in the future. Robert Kiyosaki (1947-) This is a very personal book for me, and one I have been planning to write for many years. Finally I have found the time to write it! I hope, that once you have read it, the single analytical trading technique I am going to share with you, will have as profound an effect on your trading, as it has had on mine. I stumbled on this methodology many years ago, in an almost surreal way, when I first became interested in trading. And I am eternally grateful that I did, even though, as you will see, it cost me a great deal of money at the time. Learning this method, was a defining moment in my life and trading career. I hope that this book will be equally life changing for you too. So what is this trading technique and what makes it so special? Well, it's been around for over 100 years, and was used by all the iconic traders of the past. Despite this heritage, many traders today, ignore (or are unaware) of this immensely effective analytical method. Why this is, I have no idea. It has been the cornerstone of my own trading and investing for over 16 years, and remains so today. It is immensely powerful, and in many ways 'just makes sense'. My purpose in writing this book is to convince you to embrace this for yourself. All I ask is that you open your mind, and accept the simple logic and power of what I refer to as Volume Price Analysis, or VPA for short. Volume Price Analysis is my own terminology. You will not find this description anywhere else. The reason I use it, is that it precisely describes the methodology in three simple words. After all, as traders, there is only one question we want answered with some degree of certainty, every time we trade. The question is 'where is the price going next.’ Volume Price Analysis will answer this question for you. It can be applied to all markets in all time frames, and can be used to trade all instruments. Using volume to validate and forecast future price action, has been at the heart of my trading success, and I hope that in reading this book, it will change your approach to trading forever. As I said earlier, please just open your mind to the simple logic that is VPA, and once you have read this book, you will be able to interpret charts, and forecast price action, instantly. The first time this happens will be a life changing moment for you, as you suddenly realise that you have the most powerful trading technique at your finger tips. As a trader you will become confident and calm, as your trading decisions will be based on logic, and on your own analysis of the price volume relationship. However, as I said earlier, there is nothing new or mystical here. The methodology you will discover is grounded in the approach used by the iconic traders of the past. For them, there were no computers or the
