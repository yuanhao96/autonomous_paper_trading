Chapter 1 The Covered-Write usually much more sensitive to downside risk than the long-term coveredwrite investor is and requires a stronger, bullish market view. Rates of Return Regardless of whether one is a short-term or long-term covered writer, the best outcome is a slow rise that allows the stock to appreciate in price while the option slowly decays, and, hopefully, expires worthless. This allows the investor to capture both the price appreciation in the stock and the time decay in the option, generating a profit on the overall position. The exact amount of profit depends on how the covered-write was constructed, the stock price, the option price, and the strike price. Usually covered-write strategies are analyzed in terms of rates of return at various points: • Return to Call This is the rate of return generated on the position if the stock price is at the strike price or higher at expiration, a price at which the stock would be called away by the holder of the written call. The stock price at or higher than the strike price is the best-case scenario for a covered-write: K ________  1  100% Return to call  Q R (S1  C) Where: C  Call price K  Strike price S1  Beginning stock price Example An investor buys stock at a price of $100.00 and sells a 105 strike call against it for $5.00. There are thirty days until expiration. What would be the rate of return if the stock were called? Q 105 _________  1  100%  10.53% R (100  5) • Return to Unchanged This is the rate of return generated on the position if the stock is unchanged but is still lower than the strike price at expiration, meaning an out-of-the-money call was written. This is the rate of return if the written call expires worthless while the stock remains unchanged: S2  1 R  100% Return to unchanged  Q ________ (S1  C) Where: C  Call price S1  Beginning stock price S2  Ending stock price Strategy Component Selection Example An investor buys stock at a price of $100.00 and sells a 105 strike call against it for $5.00. There are thirty days until expiration. What would be the rate of return if the stock were unchanged at expiration? Q 100 _________  1  100%  5.26% R (100  5) Return to call and Return to unchanged are variations of the same formula with the numerator representing the selling price for the stock at the end of expiration. In the case of Return to call, the numerator is represented by the strike price, because that is the price an investor would receive for his stock if it were called. In Return to unchanged it is represented by the current stock price, because that is the price an investor would receive for his stock if he wished to sell it in the open market. Break-Even Point The break-even point is the point at which the decline in stock price equals the amount of premium collected on the written call. At this point all of the protection furnished by the written call is “used up” and the investor is exposed to losses if the stock continues lower: Break-even point  S1  C Where: C  Call price S1  Beginning stock price Example You buy stock at a price of $100.00 and sell a 105 strike call against it for $5.00. There are thirty days until expiration. What is the break-even point? Break-even point  $100.00  $5.00  $95.00 STRATEGY COMPONENT SELECTION So how does one structure a good covered-write strategy? The answer to this question depends on many of the variables we have discussed in previous sections: • What is one’s current market forecast? — Neutral — Mildly bullish — Moderately bullish 15 16
