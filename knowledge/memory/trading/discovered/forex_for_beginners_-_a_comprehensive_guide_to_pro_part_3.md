Chapter 2.) Instead, currencies are exchanged over-the-counter (OTC), which is to say that transactions are executed directly between two parties. These two parties, for example, might be an individual and a bank, or two individuals, or two banks. When one party wants to place a trade, it must contact a broker or a dealer. The former serves its customers by matching up buyers and sellers, while the latter will fill orders by taking the opposite side of a trade. (This distinction is not mutually exclusive, as some firms will switch roles as it suits them.) Since currencies are always bought in pairs (one currency against one other currency) they must always be sold in pairs. In other words, the buyer and seller must necessarily be interested in taking opposing positions. For example, if a seller is interested in closing out a long position in the US dollar relative to the euro, the buyer must be interested in opening a long position in the euro against the US dollar. As with any type of financial securities trade, it is the job of the broker to sort through all of these nuances. The broker must amalgamate quotes from multiple sources and combine the best bid (the price at which currency can be sold) with the best ask (the price at which currency can be bought), and present the resulting spread to customers (Table 1-1). 7 8
