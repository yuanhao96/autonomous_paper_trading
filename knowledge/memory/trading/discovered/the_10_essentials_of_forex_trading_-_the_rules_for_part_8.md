CHAPTER 2 INTRODUCTION TO THE FOREX 19 I would make him explain it to me and the rest of the class as an insurance policy against my life. I am happy to report that both Ian and I are still alive. In fact, Ian is now an active client of ours and has taught me a lot in return. Two of the greatest things he taught me were how to perform under pressure and, more importantly, how to keep things simple with respect to teaching Forex trading. For example, at one point, Ian could only recognize and understand uptrends. “I can’t see or understand downtrends, Crown reversals, consolidations, Gartleys, or harmonic vibrations,” he told me, “but I sure can see an uptrend.” A simple fact about trading on the Forex is there are six major world currencies traded against the U.S. dollar; when three go up, the other three go down. They have to move in opposite directions to keep the world economy in balance. So when the currency of Ian’s choice stops trending up and begins to reverse and trend down, Ian goes and finds one of the other three currencies that have reversed from a downtrend and are now trending up. He keeps his trading simple. As I move forward teaching you about the Forex, I will do my best to explain the concepts in this book as if you are “Ian” and that my life is dependent on providing you with the most accurate and detailed information to help you get started. HISTORY OF THE FOREX MARKET: HOW IT ALL BEGAN BRETTON-WOODS ACCORD The modern Forex market was established around 1973. But the BrettonWoods Accord of 1944, which was established to stabilize the global economy after World War II, is generally accepted as the original beginning of the foreign exchange market. It created the concept of trading currencies against each other and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Currencies from around the world were fixed to the U.S. dollar, which in turn was fixed to gold prices in hopes of bringing stability to global Forex events. All currencies were allowed to fluctuate around that value but only within a narrow trading range. Central banks agreed to intervene in the event that their country’s currency moved or threatened to move outside that trading range. If the fixed value of a country’s currency shifted outside that trading range, that country had the right under the articles of the agreement to declare that a fundamental imbalance is in existence. As a result of this 20 THE 10 ESSENTIALS OF FOREX TRADING fundamental imbalance, it created a revaluation or devaluation of the country’s currency. In 1971, the accord finally failed, however, it did manage to stabilize major economies of the world, including those of America, Europe, and Asia. FREE-FLOATING CURRENCIES In late 1971 and 1972, two more attempts were made to establish free-floating currencies against the U.S. dollar: the Smithsonian Agreement and the European Joint Float. To “float” a currency simply means to create a policy by which a strong economic currency is used, such as the U.S. dollar (USD), which in turn is anchored to the price of gold as a benchmark (also known as the gold standard) to bring stability to a volatile global economic situation. All other weaker economic currencies are then fixed against the USD and allowed to fluctuate, or float, no more than 1 percent on either side of the fixed rate. If the fixed rate moved more than 1 percent, the central bank of that country was required to intervene in the market until the exchange rate was brought back to within the 1 percent band. The Smithsonian Agreement and the European Joint Float agreement were similar to the Bretton-Woods Accord but allowed a greater range of fluctuation in the currency values and widened the band in which currencies were allowed to trade. The Smithsonian Agreement was just a modification of the BrettonWoods Accord, with allowances for greater fluctuation, whereas the European Agreement aimed to reduce the dependence of European currencies on the U.S. dollar. But after the failure of the three agreements, nations were allowed to peg their currencies to “freely float,” eventually being mandated to do so in 1978 by the IMF. The free-floating system managed to continue for several years after the mandate, yet many countries with weaker currency values incurred major economic devaluation against certain countries that had stronger currency values. EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM European currencies were among those most affected by the strength of the U.S. dollar and the British pound (GBP). In July 1978, the European Monetary System was created to counter its dependence on the USD. But by 1993, it was clear that this European Monetary System had failed. Shortly thereafter, retail currency trading opportunities as we know them today started to be enjoyed by smaller investors willing to take similar risks as that of banks and large financial institutions.
