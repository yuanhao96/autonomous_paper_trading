Chapter 11) to improve on what I am presenting here. 115 Figure 7.26 The Oops! buy signal. Figure 7.27 The Oops! sell signal. 116 Figure 7.28 The Oops! pattern at work. How about the Bond market? Here we will take long trades any day of the week except Wednesday and a stop-loss of $1,800 from the point of entry. Our exit is the bailout technique, soon to be discussed. As shown in Figure 7.29, the results here sure blow the random walk academicians out of the water and off their ivory towers with 86 percent accuracy, 527,875 profits, and a very nice average profit per trade of $201, after commissions of $50. On the sell side, the rules are to sell on Wednesday if our Oops! opening gap and failure occur. Since 1990, there have been 55 trades with 31 winners netting $9,875 using a closer $1,000 stop and 4-day bailout Figure 7.29 Using Oops! on bond trades. 117 Figure 7.30 The results of the Oops! technique. exit. In the S&Ps, the best day to sell has been Thursday, which shows 78 percent winners and $14,200 of profits. Check out the results as shown here to solidify the value of this technique (Figures 7.30 and 7.31). The most value will come, not from a mechanical rote approach to trading, but from using this technique with some intelligence or layered on top of a setup market. Here is one such example of this type of thinking. The results in Figure 7.32 are derived from taking my Oops! buy signals in the Figure 7.31 More results with the Oops! technique. 118 Figure 7.32 Buying on any day but Thursdays with the Oops! technique. Bonds on any day but Thursday if Friday's 9-day moving average is less than Thursday's. The entry is Oops! as taught. The exit is the close on the first profitable opening after 3 days in the trade: 81 percent of these trades made money, $24,625, in fact. Check out the high average profit per trade of $373. On the sell side, the results reflect taking Oops! sell signals on Wednesday if the 9-day average is greater on Tuesday than Monday, which reflects an overbought market. These signals have been 79 percent accurate netting $13,406, and a surprising $394 profit per trade-not bad for a short-term trade, using the same rules as above for stop and exit as on the long trade (see Figure 7.33). Figure 7.33 Oops! sells on Wednesday. 119 S&P Oops! Trading The same idea meets with success in trading the S&P; here the best buy days, given the oversold criteria as established by the 9-day trend, are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. This combination shows 81 percent accuracy and $22,650 of profits with an average profit, after losses, of $456, a remarkable feat for getting in and out the same day (see Figure 7.34). The idea of the. 9-day moving average to set up the trade is based on work by Joe Krutsinger, a protege of mine and avid system developer. The best sell in this market, using the 9-day overbought technique is to take sells on Wednesday to make $18,962 with 89 percent accuracy on 35 trades (see Figure 7.35). The average profit of $486 per trade drives home the validity of the approach. Now let's look at another way of using our Oops! entries in the S&P 500. For years, researchers have noted that stock prices tend to rally around the first of the month. This sets up a perfect Oops! trade. Should this pattern occur at the end of the month, and trading day after the 17th trading day of the month, our pattern and the monthly influence come together. These are good trades! Knowing this end of the month rally spills into the next month, I tested taking all Oops! in Bonds after the first TDM through the 5th. The results are equally impressive. This combination setup is one of the most powerful shortterm trades you will find to consistently appear, month in and month out. Some observers may suggest we are curve-fitting things here by taking the Oops! signals only during a limited window of opportunity. Figure 7.34 Oops! buys in a down trend on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. 120 Figure 7.35 Oops! after the 17th trading day of the month. That could be, but let me hastily add I first became aware of this "window of opportunity" in 1962 when I read Art Merrill's classic, The Behavior of Prices on Wall Street. I believe Merrill, a delightful, white-haired grandfather figure, was the first to note the rally tendency at this time and fully discussed it in his works. All I have done is add my Oops! entry, a reasonable stop and exit, to a known market bias. To the best of my knowledge, no one noticed this same pattern or tendency exists in Bonds until 1988 when I revealed it to my students; so again, we have lots of out-of-sample experience. This is not a conclusion looking for a promise. Merrill and others, notably Norm Fosback and Glen Parker, have suggested the end-of-the-month stock rally is due to mutual funds balancing and window-dressing their holdings. Once I discovered that Bonds rally at this time, I took the position that stocks rally not because of the funds but because of Bonds. As go Bonds, so go stocks. Always keep in mind Bonds (interest rates) are the dog that wag the tail, which is stocks. Virtually any time you have a bullish outlook or bias in the market, Oops! buys are worth taking, just as Oops! sells are worth taking when you have a bearish outlook. This pattern works wonders, given an underlying reason. It is the single best pattern I have discovered; enjoy it, treat it with care, use it with wisdom.
