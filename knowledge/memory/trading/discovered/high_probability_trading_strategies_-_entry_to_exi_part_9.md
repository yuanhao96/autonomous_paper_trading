I reluctantly went to a trading conference in downtown Chicago where he was one of many speakers. I was reluctant to attend the conference because I had recently lost my cushy job at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange where I had been managing a floor trading operation, working with institutional clients in the financial futures markets. Fortunately, I decided to attend the conference, which ended up opening the door to whole new career in the trading industry. I had heard about Fibonacci retracements before, but only as they were applied to the price axis of the market. I remember the exact area of the room where I sat when Bob gave his presentation and illustrated, among other things, a very simple example of Fibonacci applied to the time axis of the market. I swear it was just like the proverbial light bulb went on above my head, and part of me knew that this was the key to my future. It was an “aha” moment. I was so fascinated by Bob’s presentation, I made my way over to his booth in the expo hall and told him how much I enjoyed his presentation. This led to shooting a couple of games of pool over cocktails, and that was the beginning of our friendship that has lasted over the years. When I started studying Bob’s work, I was so fascinated that I would work on my paper charts with a pencil, calculator, and proportional divider every chance I got. I did not own a computer at the time. Through this almost daily ritual with my hand updated paper charts, I would prove to myself how powerful were the strategies he taught. I started sharing some of my results with some friends and clients. It worked so well, some of them started offering to pay me for my analysis. I studied everything Bob had to teach over the years and perfected my trade strategies. All this eventually led to opening my own market analysis and trade recommendation business, Synchronicity Market Timing. Without Bob Miner, I would not be enjoying the very successful career I have today. Most of what I’ve learned about technical analysis and trade strategies, I learned from Bob. I am forever grateful for what he has taught me over the years as I can truly say I love my work, and they even pay me for doing it! Thanks Bob!!

If you are a new trader or one who has not yet found consistent success in the business of trading futures, stocks, or forex, you will learn specific trade strategies, from how to identify high probability trade conditions, to the specific entry and stop price, through exit strategies that are designed to maximize the gain from any trend. If you are an experienced and successful trader, I know that you will recognize several key strategies to incorporate into your existing trade plan that should immediately increase your success. I’ve been teaching these strategies for over 20 years to traders around the world. I’ve refined and simplified the strategies over the years to get to the core of the most important information a trader needs to make a trading decision and manage the trade. The combination of book and CD will provide more information in a better learning environment than I can offer in an expensive weekend workshop. You will learn my unique approach to the four main factors of technical analysis, including Multiple Time Frame Momentum setups and the one main guideline to recognize the pattern structure of trends and corrections. Plus you will learn my Dynamic Price and Time Strategies to identify in advance the probable price and time targets for trends and corrections. You will learn two powerful and logical objective entry techniques and how to manage a trade for short- and intermediate-term gains through the trade exit in any market and any time frame. I’ve also devoted an entire chapter called “Real Traders, Real Time” (
