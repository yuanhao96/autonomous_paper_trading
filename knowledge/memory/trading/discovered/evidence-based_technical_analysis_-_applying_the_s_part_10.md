Chapter 6 considers the problem of datamining bias. Although I will assert that data mining, when done correctly, is the modem technician's best method for knowledge discovery, specialized statistical tests must be applied to the results obtained with data mining. HOW EBTA IS DIFFERENT What sets EBTA apart from the popular form of TA? First, it is restricted to meaningful claims-objective methods that can be tested on historical data. Second, it utilizes advanced forms of statistical inference to determine if a profitable back test is indicative of an effective method. Thus, Introduction 7 the prime focus of EBTA is determining which objective methods are worthy of actual use. EBTA rejects all forms of subjective TA. Subjective TA is not even wrong. It is worse than wrong. Statements that can be qualified as wrong (untrue) at least convey cognitive content that can be tested. The propositions of subjective TA offer no such thing. Though, at first blush, they seem to convey knowledge, when they are examined critically, it becomes clear they are empty claims. Promoters of New Age health cures excel at empty claims. They tell you that wearing their magic copper bracelet will make you will feel better and put more bounce in your step. They suggest your golf game will improve and maybe even your love life. However, the claim's lack of specificity makes it impossible to nail down exactly what is being promised or how it can be tested. Such claims can never be confirmed or contradicted with objective evidence. On these same grounds, it can be said that the propositions of subjective TA are empty and thus insulated from empirical challenge. They must be taken on faith. In contrast, a meaningful claim is testable because it makes measurable promises. It states specifically how much your golf game will improve or how bouncy your steps will be. This specificity opens the claim to being contradicted with empirical evidence. From the perspective of EBTA, proponents of subjective methods are faced with a choice: They can reformulate the method to be objective, as one practitioner of the Elliott Wave Principle has done,14 thus exposing it to empirical refutation, or they must admit the method must be accepted on faith. Perhaps Gann lines actually provide useful information. In their present form, we are denied this knowledge. With respect to objective TA, EBTA does not take profitable back tests at face value. Instead, they are subjected to rigorous statistical evaluation to determine if profits were due to luck or biased research. As will be pointed out in
