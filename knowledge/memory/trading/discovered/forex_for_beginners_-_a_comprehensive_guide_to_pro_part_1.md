Chapter 1 | Historical Background to mop up the mess with (often controversial) counsel and loans, with the effect that most currency crises have been short-lived. In the aftermath of every crisis comes the inevitable debate over whether the former economic system should be revived, and the financial crisis of 2008–2011 has been no exception to that rule. Economic conservatives argue that the US dollar will be ruined by the high level of US debt, and they proffer the reinstatement of the gold peg as the only real solution. Fiat currencies have given unlimited power to government and no check on their ability to print unlimited amounts of money. Critics of the euro, meanwhile, insist that the currency union never made sense and that fiscal and economic discrepancies will soon render it extinct. In addition, the record spikes in volatility that accompanied the financial crisis of 2008 to 2011 have triggered the predictable calls for a cap on speculation. Policymakers have invoked the so-called Tobin Tax, which would levy a nominal fee on all forex trades, and use the proceeds to help central banks fend off speculative attacks on their currencies.

There may be further currency consolidation (within Asia and/or Africa), but no country is likely to unilaterally reinstate the gold standard. Barring any unforeseen developments, currencies will continue to fluctuate against each other in accordance with market forces. 5 6
