Even though trading on foreign exchange options, stock options, commodity options and index options is available 24 -hours a day, five days a week, not every hour or minute is worth trading. There are different hours during the day and different days of the week which see more volume and liquidity than others, resulting in high volatility and opportunities to maximize trading. Overlaps - the peak time The binary options market is most active when there is an overlap of the London/New York and Asia/London sessions. The market experiences a high volume of trades at these times. When more than one market is active, you can expect to see increased volatility, meaning that prices move around more and in a clearer direction. During off-peak hours, there is little volume and less price movement, resulting in flat and directionless markets.

In the US, trading activity picks up sharply around 8:30 am EST. this is due to the release of closely watched US economic data, which generates the liquidity and volatility needed for the underlying asset to reach its target price before the option expires. Prices become most volatile when the US releases its monthly non-farm payrolls report on the first Friday of every month. In contrast, markets will be less active and liquid during major holidays in the US and Europe, resulting in subdued trade. There are days that see more volatility and price action than others. According to our research, Tuesday and Wednesday are considered to be the most active trading days of the week. Friday is also recognized as a high-volatility trading day, especially during the hours when European and US trading sessions overlap. During the second half of the day, price movements can be very unpredictable.
