Section 9, “Risk Management”). The absolute maximum a trader may risk on any trade is two percent of his account equity. For example, if you have $30,000 in your account, you may not risk more than $600 per trade, and if you have $10,000, you may not risk more than $200. If your account is small, limit yourself to trading fewer shares, less expensive futures, or mini-contracts. If you see an attractive trade, but a logical stop would have to be placed where more than 2 percent of equity would be at risk—pass on that trade.You may risk less, but you may never risk more.You must avoid risking more than 2 percent on a trade the way a recovering alcoholic avoids bars. A trader who blames high commissions on a broker and slippage on a floor trader gives up control of his trading life. Try to reduce both, but take responsibility for them. If you lose even a dollar more than your businessman’s risk, including commissions and slippage, you are a loser. Do you keep good trading records? Poor record-keeping is a sure sign of a gambler. Good businessmen keep good records.Your trading records must show the date and price of every entry and exit, slippage, commissions, stops, all adjustments of stops, reasons for entering, objectives for exiting, maximum paper profit, maximum paper loss after a stop was hit, and any other data necessary to review and fully understand your trade later in the future. If you bail out of a trade within your businessman’s risk, it is normal business. There is no bargaining, no waiting for another tick, no hoping for a change. Losing a dollar more than your established businessman’s risk is like getting drunk, getting into a brawl, getting sick to your stomach on your way home, and waking up in a gutter.You would never want that to happen. A Meeting for One When you go to an AA meeting, you’ll see people who have not had a drink in years stand up and say: “Hello, my name is so-and-so, and I am an alcoholic.” Why do they call themselves alcoholics after years of sobriety? Because if they think they have beaten alcoholism, they will start drinking again. If a person stops thinking he is an alcoholic, he is free to take a drink, then another, and will probably end up in the gutter again. A person who wants to stay sober must remember that he is an alcoholic for the rest of his life. Traders would benefit from our own self-help organization—I’d call it Losers Anonymous. Why not Traders Anonymous? Because a harsh name helps focus attention on our self-destructive tendencies. After all, Alcoholics Anonymous doesn’t call itself Drinkers Anonymous. As long as you call yourself a loser, you’ll focus on avoiding losses. Several traders have argued against what they thought was the “negative thinking” of Losers Anonymous. A retired woman from Texas, a highly successful trader, described her approach. She is very religious, prays every morning, and then drives to an office where she actively trades. Whenever the market starts moving against her, she cuts her losses very fast because it would not please the Lord for her to lose His Get More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com 10. WINNERS AND LOSERS 27 money. I thought that our methods were similar.The goal is to cut losses due to some objective, external rule. Trading within a businessman’s risk is like living without alcohol. A trader has to admit that he is a loser, just as a drunk has to admit that he is an alcoholic. Then he can begin his journey to recovery. This is why every morning before trading I suggest saying: “Good morning, my name is so-and-so, and I am a loser. I have it in me to do serious financial damage to my account.” â•—This is like an AA meeting—it keeps your mind focused on the first principles. Even if you take thousands of dollars out of the market today, tomorrow you say: “Good morning, my name is so-and-so and I am a loser.” A friend of mine joked: “When I sit in front of my quote screen in the morning, I say, ‘My name is John, and I’m gonna rip your throat out.’” His thinking generates tension. “Losers Anonymous” thinking generates serenity. A trader who feels serene and relaxed can focus on looking for the best and safest trades. When a sober man and a drunk enter a race, you know who is more likely to win. A drunk may win once in a while, but the sober man is the one to bet on. You want to be the sober man in that race. ■■10. Winners and Losers We come to trading from different walks of life and bring along our mental baggage. Many of us find that when we act in the market the way we do in our everyday life, we lose money. Most of all, your success or failure depends on your ability to use intellect rather than act emotionally. A trader who feels overjoyed when he wins and depressed when he loses is at the mercy of market moves and cannot accumulate equity. To be a winner in the market you must act coolly and responsibly.The pain of losing drives people to look for magic methods. At the same time, they discard much of what is useful in their professional or business backgrounds. Like an Ocean The market is like an ocean—it moves up and down regardless of what you wish. You may feel joy when you buy a stock and it explodes in a rally. You may feel drenched with fear when you go short but the market rises, melting your equity with every uptick. Those feelings have nothing to do with the market—they exist only inside of you. The market doesn’t know you exist.You can do nothing to influence it. The ocean doesn’t care about your welfare, but it has no wish to hurt you either. You can only control your behavior. A sailor cannot control the ocean, but he can control himself. He can study currents and weather patterns, learn good sailing techniques, and gain experience. He can learn when to sail and when to stay in the harbor. A successful sailor uses his intelligence. 28 INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY An ocean can be useful—you can fish in it and use its surface to get to other islands. An ocean can be dangerou
