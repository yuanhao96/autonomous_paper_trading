Chapter 6, I explain how to draw Fibonacci retracement grids, how to find Fibonacci price confluence, and how a Fibonacci retracement grid assists your trade identification, entry, and exit decisions, all while keeping the examples current and simple to understand; Fibonacci analysis need not be complex. I conclude the section on modern-day strategies by explaining the Life Cycle of a Stock move, from accumulation through realization, and into the final stage of distribution, explaining insights into how professionals behave against the crowd at all stages. The chapter includes a quick description on how Elliott Wave complements Charles Dow's original work on trends, and how both techniques combine in today's world of active trading. No book on trading strategies would be complete without a discussion on edge, execution tactics, trade setups, and how to put the information into practice in real-time under conditions of uncertainty and heightened emotion.
