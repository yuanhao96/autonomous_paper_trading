Chapter 60, Same-Store Sales, Bad. Volume. This is not a rule but a guideline: Volume is usually above average on the day of the sales announcement. Focus on Failures What can go wrong with the 3S pattern? In a moment, we look at the statistics, and they suggest that this is a risky pattern for traders. Why? Because price often returns to the breakout price and continues lower. Figure 61.3 shows an example. Price was trending down leading to the pattern, so that trend is the first clue that you should trade this pattern with caution. If you obey the “trade with the trend” folklore, then you would short the stock after the announcement once a downturn becomes clear. In early September, an announcement said that same-store sales were up 10% and earnings were in line with consensus estimates. Good news! Prices gapped upward. In following days, the upward momentum slowed. The saying “buy on the rumor, sell on the news” gripped traders, and price gapped down after the release of earnings.

Figure 61.4 shows another cautionary tale and a typical example of how the 3S pattern behaves: Price jumps up and peaks quickly then tumbles. That happened in the March 3S pattern. Six insiders sold shares right at the March peak, and then the stock dropped to a low of 18.70 in April for a peak to trough decline of 24%. A large giveback if you owned the stock. The June announcement of 12% same-store sales powered the stock up the price mountain. This time, nearly a dozen insiders dumped the stock. Another sales announcement occurred in July, and it was a surprise because price gapped upward. Price summits at 27.15 and then slips on the icy slope, starting an avalanche. Price snowballs downward until it rolls into base camp at 14 and change. The point of these figures is a simple one. Pay attention. If price starts heading down, sell. Statistics The following tables use data from over 500 stocks boiled down to just 29 retailers from early 1995 to late 2003. I tossed many of the patterns because they did not obey the identification guidelines shown in Table 61.1. Table 61.2 shows general performance statistics for the 3S patterns based on surprisingly good same-store sales. 4366_61.qxd 2/23/05 12:27 PM Page 927 Statistics 927 Table 61.2 General Statistics Description Bull Market Bear Market Number of formations 272 82 Reversal (R) or continuation (C) 100 R, 172 C 28 R, 54 C R/C performance 28% R, 20% C 14% R, 14% C Average rise 23% 14% Rises over 45% 59 or 22% 6 or 7% Change after trend ends –28% –31% Busted pattern performance –20% –27% Standard & Poor’s 500 change 7% 1% Days to ultimate high 64 41 Note: Minus sign means decline. Number of formations. I found enough patterns (354) to split them into bull and bear markets. Still, the 82 I found in bear markets is a bit slim, so remember that as we review the statistics. Reversal or continuation. The vast majority of patterns acted as continuations of the prevailing price trend. That is, most had price rising into the pattern, and I only accepted those with upward breakouts. In a bull market, reversals vastly outperformed continuations, 28% to 20%. Average rise. The average rise was an anemic 23% in bull markets, and 14% in bear markets. Why the blood loss? Because I measured the rise from the formation high to the ultimate high. Thus, not included in the results were price gaps that sometimes occurred on the announcement day. Including the gaps, the rise measured 27% in a bull market and 18% in a bear market (from the prior close to the ultimate high). Those percentages are still below the average rise for all chart pattern types. Thus, no matter how long your ruler is, this pattern does not measure up. Rises over 45%. In a bull market, 22% of the patterns rise more than 45%, but just 7% in a bear market rise over 45%. Both rates are small, suggesting that this pattern may lead you to poverty, not profit. Change after trend ends. Once price reaches the ultimate high, it drops between 28% and 31%, on average. This finding shows how well you might do if you trade perfectly after a 3S pattern completes. Since this is a best-case scenario, your results will likely be lower. Busted pattern performance. If prices rise less than 5% after the breakout, price then tumbles between 20% and 27%, depending on market conditions. Since busted patterns are easier to spot than trend changes, this characteristic shows how well you might do when shorting the pattern. Again, the results are best case, measured from the ultimate high after the breakout to the ultimate low. Your results will likely be less. I suggest you short after price 4366_61.qxd 2/23/05 928 12:27 PM Page 928 Same-Store Sales, Good closes below the low in the 3S pattern. That way you can be sure of a trend change, but use stops just in case. Standard & Poor’s 500 change. The S&P 500 index climbed an average of 7% and 1% in bull and bear markets, respectively, as measured from the 3S pattern’s breakout date to the ultimate high date. Days to ultimate high. How long did it take price to reach the ultimate high? About 2 months (64 days) in a bull market and about 6 weeks (41 days) in a bear market. In both markets, this is quick because the rise is so small. The numbers show that the slope of the rise in both markets is about the same. Table 61.3 shows the failure rates for the 3S patt
