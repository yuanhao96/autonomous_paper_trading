A trendfollowing indicator may be giving a buy signal, while an oscillator is giving a sell signal, or vice versa. The Triple Screen trading system is designed to manage those contradictory signals. Answer 7-2: B The Triple Screen trading system begins by identifying the trend on a chart one order of magnitude greater than the one you are planning to trade. Find the trend on the weekly chart and then look for entry points in that direction on the dailies. If you begin by analyzing the daily chart and only check the weekly chart later, your eyes will be prejudiced by what you saw on the daily chart. A monthly chart is too far removed from the daily—the timeframes of two charts should relate to one another by a factor of five. A weekly bar contains the data from 5 daily bars. 123 124 ANSWERS Answer 7-3: C Keeping good records is essential for testing a system. Start at the beginning of your data file and move forward one day at a time, recording each signal and planned actions. Watching signals emerge and gradually deliver paper profits and losses is the closest you can get to real trading without risking money. If you like what you see and start trading that system in your account, keep your positions small. Concentrate on learning how the system works in the real world before gradually increasing position size. Since you cannot know exactly how others may use this system, their feedback is not nearly as meaningful as your own results. Answer 7-4: B The entry, the target, and the stop are the three essential numbers for every trade— you must write them down before you enter. They provide the structure for every trade, allowing you to compare risk and reward and decide what size to trade. A trade without these numbers is not a trade but a gamble. Counting profits in an open trade will only distract you from managing that trade. Answer 7-5: B A directional trader has three choices: buy, sell, or stand aside. The first screen of Triple Screen acts as a censor that takes away one of those choices.You may look for trades only in the direction of the long-term timeframe or stand aside. Answer 7-6: C When the first screen of the Triple Screen trading system points up, use declines of a short-term oscillator to find buying opportunities. When the first screen points down, use rallies of a short-term oscillator to identify shorting opportunities. This rule helps avoid chasing uptrends and downtrends. In this example, the short-term oscillator is already overbought; wait for it to decline before going long. Answer 7-7: B When the weekly trend is up but the daily trend is down, Triple Screen points to a buying opportunity. One of the options is to place a buy-stop above the last day’s high to catch a short-term upside breakout. Answer 7-8: C The uptrend of Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) on the weekly chart is confirmed by its rising EMA as well as the uptrend of MACD-Histogram. The weekly uptrend leads to a strategic decision to look only for buying opportunities on the daily chart. There we see a pullback to the EMA, while the Force Index below zero indicates an oversold condition. According to Triple Screen, pullbacks on the daily charts during weekly uptrends signal buying opportunities. Place a buy order above the latest daily high. The fact that the weekly and daily trends are in conflict is a normal occurrence in the markets—it is the purpose of the Triple Screen to resolve such conflicts to your benefit.

When the weekly trend is down and the daily trend is up, use those rallies for entering shorts. Trying to enter a trade when both weekly and daily trends are moving in the same direction is like hopping aboard a moving train. It can be done, but it’s safer to wait for a pullback. Answer 7-10: A The slope of the fast EMA tracks the market’s inertia, while the slope of the MACDHistogram reflects the direction of market power. The primary role of the Impulse system is not to tell traders when to buy or sell. Rather, it shows them when they’re prohibited from buying or shorting. It is a censorship system, and when the Impulse system is red, it prohibits buying. It removes that prohibition when its color changes from the bearish red to a neutral blue or a bullish green. Answer 7-11: 1 = A; 2 = C; 3 = B; 4 = C The color of the Impulse system depends on its two components—an EMA and MACD-Histogram. When both are rising, the Impulse turns green—bullish, prohibiting short trades. When both decline, the Impulse turns red—bearish, forbidding buying. When these two components contradict one another, the Impulse turns blue—neutral. Answer 7-12: 1 = E and H; 2 = A and C; 3 = B, D, F, G and I The Impulse system is a censorship system. When both the EMA and MACD-Histogram turn down, coloring the bar red, it prohibits buying.When both indicators turn up, coloring the bar green, shorting is not allowed. The Impulse system shouldn’t be used as an automatic trading method: while it catches every trend, it would subject an automatic trader to multiple whipsaws, for example, in the area between the letters C and G. Its best signals emerge when red or green colors disappear. For example, the disappearance of red at the bar G showed that the double bottom was being completed and sugge
