Chapter 4 “Mind—The Disciplined Trader.” Additional Reading Douglas, Mark. The Disciplined Trader (New York: New York Institute of Finance, 1990). Elder, Alexander. Trading for a Living (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1993). See “Individual Psychology” and “Mass Psychology” (pages 11–68). LeFevre, Edwin. Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (New York: George H. Doran Company, 1923). T H R E E BASIC CHARTING Answer 19 C. 4 and 5. Give yourself four points for choosing this answer, or two points if you answered B (one correct out of two). Prices are not a mirror image of values and can swing considerably above and below value. Undecided traders who have the money and watch the market influence it by their presence, putting pressure on buyers and sellers to act faster. Answer 20 1. C 2. A 3. B 4. D Give yourself a point for each correct answer. Nonprofessional traders are more likely to form their opinions in the evening and place orders before going to work in the morning. Professionals are more likely to dominate the market near closing time. The high tick of every bar shows the limit of bullish power and the lowest tick the limit of bearish power during that bar. 97 98 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Answer 21 1. C, D 2. B, C 3. A 4. E 5. B 6. D Give yourself a point for each correct answer (half a point if you got one out of two). Add two points if you got the bonus question right, or a point for getting it partly right. Uptrendlines connect bottoms of rallies (line A), and downtrendlines connect tops of declines (line B). Zones that served as support on the way down become resistance on the way up, and vice versa (line C). The behavior of prices at the tops sometimes mirrors that at the nearby bottoms—a false upside breakout B was followed by a false downward breakout D. Notice that Figure 3.1 is the chart of the Mexico Index— technical analysis knows no borders. At the right edge, neutral to bullish. Prices are rallying from a false downside breakout, a bullish pattern. The rally is seven days old and approaching a downtrendline, where prices are likely to run into stiff resistance—potentially bearish. If prices break through, the next upside target will be at the level of the early July peak. Answer 22 1. D 2. A 3. B, C, E 4. F BASIC CHARTING 99 Give yourself a point for each correct answer (half a point if you missed a tail). Add two points if you got the bonus question right, or a point for getting it partly right. Downtrendlines (A) connect successively lower tops of rallies, and uptrendlines (D) track rising bottoms. A break of a trendline often signals the end of a trend. Tails (B, C, and E) show what levels prices have tested and rejected. Prices recoil from kangaroo tails. Channel lines (F) can be drawn parallel to trendlines, framing the limits of bullishness and bearishness. At the right edge—toppy, time to take profits on long positions. The stock is overbought, hitting its upper channel line—short-term bearish. Wait for a pullback into the lower half of the channel before going long. Answer 23 1. C-D, G-H 2. A, I, J 3. E 4. F 5. A-B, J-K Give yourself a point for each correct answer (half a point if you got one but not the other occurrence). Add two points if you got the bonus question right, or a point for getting it partly right. Price levels that serve as support on the way down become resistance on the way up, which is especially well illustrated by line C-D. Volume spikes A, I, and J indicate that a move is nearing an end. A decline may stop immediately, as it did in area I, or continue to slide, as it did in areas A and J, creating bullish divergences A-B and J-K. Areas E and F are among several examples on this chart in which volume rises during downswings and shrinks on upswings, which is typical bear market behavior. 100 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES At the right edge—bullish in the short run, bearish for the longer term. Merck is in a major downtrend, having fallen from above 95 to near 60 in the eight months covered by this chart. Prices are inching higher toward a heavy overhead resistance G-H, while volume is shrinking, showing that bulls are weak and prices are likely to recoil once they reach their overhead resistance. Rating Yourself Below 21 Poor. Chart reading is basic literacy for market analysts. Indicators are important, but first you need to get a handle on the basics. Please return to the recommended reading materials, study them, and retake this test a few days later, before proceeding to the rest of the Study Guide. 21–25 Fairly good. You understand and can use the key concepts of charting. Still, it would pay to return to the recommended materials, review them, fill in the gaps, and retake the test before proceeding to more advanced computerized analysis. 26–29 Excellent. You can read the charts like an open book. Time to move on and test your knowledge of modern computerized technical analysis. Required Reading Elder, Alexander.
