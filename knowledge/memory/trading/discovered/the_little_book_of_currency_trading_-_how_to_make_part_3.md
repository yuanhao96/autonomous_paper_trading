Chapter 8 is dedicated completely to understanding and using them to position into trades. Exhibit 7.3 Joining the Trend Using Bollinger Bands Source: GFT Dealbook 360. Bag Your Winners Quickly Although staying with the trend will give you an edge in trading forex, the real secret to developing consistency is to bag your winners quickly. Most traders spend hours and hours looking for the perfect entry point and barely give their exits a passing thought, but it is the exits that can separate the winners from the losers. When I was trading at a major investment bank, I sat between two experienced forex traders named Tom and Masa. One day, they went long and short the EUR/USD at the exact time. By the end of the day, both were profitable. Why? Because Tom was only looking to make 20 pips on a large position and remained in his trade for less than an hour while Masa nursed his trade for most of the day, rode out the initial losses and waited for the currency to turn around and hit his profit target of 50 pips. The entry in this case did not matter at all because Tom and Masa took opposing positions at the exact same time. Instead, what made them both winners was their exit. In Trading or Investing 101, all of us are taught to maintain a strict 2 to 1 risk/reward ratio or better. In other words, for every $100 risked, we need to look to make $200. The reason is that we need to be right only 50 percent of the time to be net positive and even less if the risk/reward ratio is higher. For example, if you had a trading strategy that risked 50 points for a return of 150 points on every trade, you would only need to be successful 30 percent of the time to be net positive. In other words, if 7 out of 10 trades were losers and 3 were winners, the net return would still be 100 points. Sounds attractive, right? The standard trading advice is to have your winners be much larger than your losers, but anyone who has traded currencies has most likely experienced the frustration of watching the trade turn profitable, but for one reason or another, the profits start to disappear like ice cubes in your hand and eventually turn into a losing trade. The problem is that markets are generally not that generous, and for some traders, 2 to 1 risk/reward ratios may be ideal but not realistic. Imagine a short-term trader who is only looking to risk 35 pips on a given trade. To keep with a strict 2:1 ratio, he would need to make 70 pips on the trade. However, on any given day, a currency pair only moves an average of 100 pips, which means that in the isolated amount of time that he is available to monitor the trade, he is looking to make 70 percent of an average day’s move. Another possible scenario is that our trader plans to make 20 pips per trade. Under a 2:1 ratio, he needs to set his stop at 10 pips. However a 10-pip stop can be clipped at the blink of an eye, particularly since the spread reduces the stop by 2 to 3 pips, depending upon which currency is traded. An overly ideal risk to reward ratio encourages traders to try and take more from the market than is being offered and may encourage scalpers to use excessively tight stops. So how do you overcome this? By using the T1-T2 method. To minimize the risk of letting profits melt in their hands like ice cubes on a hot sunny day, many professional traders like to bag their winners quickly using a T1-T2 method to exit of their trades. T1 simply refers to Target 1 and T2 refers to Target 2. Not only have I met many traders who say that the T1-T2 method has transformed their returns but I use this methodology in my own trading. The idea is to have a conservative, relatively easy-to-achieve first target and a more ambitious second target. So if I am looking to risk 40 pips on my trade, my first target should be approximately 40 pips. In order for me to be net positive, my strategy needs to hit 60 to 70 percent more winners than losers. However, with a smaller first target of 40 pips, the chances of the limit being reached can be greater than a target of 70 pips. When the target is hit, I would close out half of the position and move my stop to breakeven on the remainder of the position. The idea is to limit your losses to your initial entry point. If the trade continues to move in my favor, then I will trail the stop to lock in more profits. If the trade moves backwards to stop me out at my initial entry price, which is known as breakeven, the overall trade would still be a positive one because I banked profits on the first half of the position. Why does this work? We have all heard the statement that 20 percent of employees generate 80 percent of a company’s output and 20 percent of customers provide 80 percent of the revenue. To some degree, the same as true in trading. Trends can be strong and it is important to try to capture as much of a trend move as possible, while at the same time limiting your risk. Floating profits are just that—floating. They can hit an iceberg anytime, which is why I believe it is much better to take partial profits early and try to ride the rest to glory with only a part of the position. When it comes to trading, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Human psychology is also a big reason why the T1-T2 method works well for many traders. My business partner, Boris Schlossberg, posed a very good question to make an important point to our clients: “Suppose I gave you a choice. You can take ten trades, nine of which would lose you $10,000 each or $90,000 in total and the tenth would make you $120,000 for a net profit of $30,000. Or you can take ten trades of which seven would make you $20,000 each and three would lose you $40,000 each for a net profit of $20,000. Which would you prefer?” On the surface the first strategy appears to make you more money but 90 percent of traders will most likely wind up losers under that method. Why? Human beings hate to lose. Furthermore, they hate to lose consistently. If you deconstruct the first str
