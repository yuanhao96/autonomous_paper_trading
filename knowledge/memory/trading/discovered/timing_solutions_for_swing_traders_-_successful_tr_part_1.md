Chapter 2, Let’s Get Started. We feel the subjects covered will be more than adequate for trading stocks. There are many dos and don’ts regarding interpretation of analysis that we have encountered in our 35 years of trading experience, and the book describes how to interpret developing patterns and trends. It also gives examples of how mechanical trading systems are designed, and how a standard indicator could be incorporated into a system. Taken together with the emerging trend of fusing technical analysis with cycle analysis and financial astrology, it is hoped the book may serve as a useful guide and inspire novice as well as veteran traders to further their techniques in the areas covered. How to gauge different market scenarios is one of the trickiest issues facing traders every day. To help develop your trading techniques, the book contains many charts illustrating how to assess and analyze different kinds of conditions. The charts have been produced from various vendors’ software programs. By the end, traders should have further advanced to an all-around understanding of using technical analysis in formulating a profitable trading plan In the book, we have demonstrated a simple concept of a trading method. The stocks are selected at random and are not selected to fit the system. The system is not a mechanical or fully automated trading system, and parameters of the system and indicators are not optimized. The basic formulas used in the system are provided for reference. The formulas are simple and easy for traders to use. It should be easy also to adjust them for incorporation (with their personal system design) into their personal trading method. The program has a built-in color trend indicator to alert traders to the state of the stocks in the short time frame, and to validate the short-term trend by the medium-term indicators of the system. In essence, we want to trade when the short-term trend is moving in tandem with the medium-term trend, and trade signals are executed only in the direction of the longer trend frame. The application requires discretionary traders’ decisions to anticipate market outlook for the intermediate trend. It uses candlestick patterns, Elliott Wave Principle, volume, and the interplay of three longer-term moving averages to decide whether relevant price rallies or corrections are expected to be short-lived or the start of a longer trend. It is also recommended to include a protective stop-loss system in every trading system. There are no standard parameters or definitive methods for applying stop-loss. Each trader has to define his own acceptable risk to set the appropriate stop-loss. For reference, the formula of a simple indicator for stop-loss has been included together with formulas of the various indicators mentioned in the book. To a large extent, the success of trading depends on your frame of mind, money management ability, and trading methodology. Having a healthy frame of mind is a prerequisite for trading stocks. The mind greatly influences how you trade and how you manage your financial risk. Trading is all about making mental decisions. A frame of mind that is negative, tired, or anxious is not the right condition for trading anything. On the other hand, a healthy and cheerful attitude and learning to take a break from trading are indispensable factors in the unceasing quest to achieve the best trading results. Robert T. H.
