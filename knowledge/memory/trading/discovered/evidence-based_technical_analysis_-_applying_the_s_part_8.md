Chapter 3, testing a claim on the basis of a discernible difference is central to the scientific method. Hall, in his book Practically Profound, explains why he finds Freudian psychoanalysis to be meaningless when examined in light of the discernible-difference test. "Certain Freudian claims about human sexual development are compatible with all possible states of affairs. There is no way to confirm or disconfirm either 'penis envy' or 'castration complex' because there is no distinguishable difference between evidence affirming and evidence denying these interpretations of behavior. Exactly opposite behaviors are equally predictable, depending on whether the alleged psychosexual stress is overt or repressed." The requirement of "cognitive content rules out all utterances that are so loose, poorly formed or obsessively held (e.g., conspiracy theories) that there is no recognizable difference between what would be the case if they were so, and what would be the case if they were not."8 In a like vein, the Intelligent Design Theory carries no cognitive freight in the sense that no matter what life form is observed it is INTRODUCTION consistent with the notion that it manifests an underlying form specified by some intelligent designer. 9 What then is knowledge? Knowledge can be defined asjustijied true belief Hence, in order for a declarative statement to qualify as knowledge, not only must it be a candidate for belief, because it has cognitive content, but it must meet two other conditions as well. First, it must be true (or probably true). Second, the statement must be believed with justification. A belief is justified when it is based on sound inferences from solid evidence. Prehistoric humans held the false belief that the sun moved across the sky because the sun orbited the earth. Clearly they were not in possession of knowledge, but suppose that there was a prehistoric person who believed correctly that the sun moved across the sky because of the earth's rotation. Although this belief was true, this individual could not be described as possessing knowledge. Even though they believed what astronomers ultimately proved to be true, there was no evidence yet to justify that belief. Without justification, a true belief does not attain the status of knowledge. These concepts are illustrated in Figure 1.1. ~\\ Statements Empty Claims FIGURE I. t Knowledge: justified true belief. Introduction 5 From this it follows that erroneous beliefs or false knowledge fail to meet one or more of the necessary conditions of knowledge. Thus, an erroneous belief can arise either because it concerns a meaningless claim or because it concerns a claim that, though meaningful, is not justified by valid inferences from solid evidence. Still, even when we have done everything right, by drawing the best possible inference from sound evidence, we can still wind up adopting erroneous beliefs. In other words, we can be justified in believing a falsehood, and honestly claim to know something, if it appears to be true according to logically sound inferences from the preponderance of available evidence. "We are entitled to say 'I know' when the target of that claim is supported beyond reasonable doubt in the network of well-tested evidence. But that is not enough to guarantee that we do know."lo Falsehoods are an unavoidable fact of life when we attempt to know things about the world based on observed evidence. Thus, knowledge based on the scientific method is inherently uncertain, and provisional, though less uncertain than knowledge acquired by less formal methods. However, over time, scientific knowledge improves, as it comes to describe reality in a progressively more accurate manner. It is a continual work in progress. The goal of EBTA is a body of knowledge about market behavior that is as good as can be had, given the limits of evidence gathering and the powers of inference. ERRO EOUS 'IJ\ KNOWLEDGE: THE COST OF UNDISCIPLINED ANALYSIS To understand why the knowledge produced by the popular version ofTA is untrustworthy, we must consider two distinct forms of TA: subjective and objective. Both approaches can lead to erroneous beliefs, but they do so in distinct ways. Objective TA methods are well defined repeatable procedures that issue unambiguous signals. This allows them to be implemented as computerized algorithms and back-tested on historical data. Results produced by a back test can be evaluated in a rigorous quantitative manner. Subjective TA methods are not well-defined analysis procedures. Because of their vagueness, an analyst's private interpretations are required. This thwarts computerization, back testing, and objective performance evaluation. In other words, it is impossible to either confirm or deny a subjective method's efficacy. For this reason they are insulated from evidentiary challenge. 6 INTRODUCTION From the standpoint of EBTA, subjective methods are the most problematic. They are essentially meaningless claims that give the illusion of conveying cognitive content. Because the methods do not specify how they are to be applied, different analysts applying it to the same set of market data can reach different conclusions. This makes it impossible to determine if the method provides useful predictions. Classical chart pattern analysis, II hand-drawn trend lines, Elliott Wave Principle,12 Gann patterns, Magic T's and numerous other subjective methods fall into this category.13 Subjective TA is religion-it is based on faith. No amount of cherry-picked examples showing where the method succeeded can cure this deficiency. Despite their lack of cognitive content and the impossibility of ever being supported by sound evidence, there is no shortage of fervent believers in various subjective methods.
