Chapter 5 “Trading.” Additional Reading McMillan, Lawrence G. Options as a Strategic Investment, 3rd ed. (New York: New York Institute of Finance, 1999). Teweles, Richard J., and Frank J. Jones. The Futures Game, 3rd ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1998). E I G H T MONEY MANAGEMENT Answer 68 Choice 5 is correct. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. A system with a positive expectation allows you to make money over a long series of trades—it gives you an edge but not a guarantee of success. A system may deliver more losing than winning trades but still be profitable if winners are bigger than losers. Each individual trade is dicey, but a well-designed system creates a positive expectation over a long series of trades. Money management can protect a trader using such a system, but it cannot turn a losing system into a winner. Answer 69 1. 533 2. 24 3. 69 4. 18,750 5. 37.5% Give yourself a point for each correct answer. Modern society makes it easy to live without counting, but if you want to succeed in trading you have to think—and count—on your feet. You may own a calculator, but you must be able at least to estimate the results of any arithmetic operation in your head. 127 128 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Answer 70 Choice 3 is correct. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. The 2% Rule, the most important rule of money management, protects you from ever losing more than 2% of your account equity on any single trade. If your stop is close and risk per share is small, you may trade a bigger size, as long as you are mindful of the overnight risk. If the stop is far and risk per share is high, the size has to be smaller because your total dollar risk may never exceed 2% of your account equity. Answer 71 B. 1 and 2. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer, or two points if you answered C. According to the 2% Rule, you may not risk more than 2% of your account equity on any given trade, including commissions and slippage. Having a $50,000 account allows you to risk no more than $1,000 per trade. Trade 1: you risk $1.50 per share on 500 shares, for a total of $750, which is acceptable. Trade 2: you risk $3 per share on 300 shares, for a total of $900, which is acceptable. Both trades leave room for slippage and commissions. Trade 3: you risk $1 per share on 1,000 shares, for a total of $1,000, which leaves no room for slippage or commissions. Trade 4: you risk $6 per share on 200 shares, for a total of $1,200, which would break the 2% limit. Trade 5: you risk $2 per share on 700 shares, for a total of $1,400, which would break the 2% limit. Answer 72 A. 1, 3 B. 2, 4, 5 Give yourself a point for each correct answer. The key rule of money management is never risk more than 2% of your account on any given trade. The dividing line is drawn at 2%—if you risk less, it is a businessman’s risk, and if you risk more, you are MONEY MANAGEMENT 129 staring at a loss. Two percent of $100,000 comes to $2,000, 2% of $20,000 to only $400—this is your maximum permitted risk per trade. Trade 1: you risk $1.25 per share on 1,000 shares for a total of $1,250— less than 2% of a $100,000 account (businessman’s risk). Trade 2: you risk $2 per share on 300 shares for a total of $600—more than 2% of a $20,000 account (risk of loss). Trade 3: you risk $1.50 per share on 200 shares for a total of $300—less than 2% of a $20,000 account (businessman’s risk). Trade 4: you risk $4 per share on 1,000 shares for a total of $4,000—more than 2% of a $100,000 account (risk of loss). Trades 2 and 4 could still be done, only with a smaller size, pushing the risk below 2% of each account. In trade 5, without a stop, what if that stock slides to $5, which could happen in a bear market? Busting through the 2% risk limit can damage even the biggest account. Answer 73 Yes. Give yourself three points for choosing the right answer. Bill plans to risk $4 per share on 100 shares, or $400, plus commissions and slippage. The 2% Rule allows him to risk up to $500. His trade is within the limits of the 2% Rule. Still, he is pushing it a bit. As a beginner, he’d better stay farther away from the 2% limit. Perhaps he could focus on lower-priced stocks and work on his analysis, entry, and exit techniques without coming so close to the 2% limit. Answer 74 Yes. Give yourself three points for choosing the right answer. Since a gold futures contract has 100 ounces, a trader wins or loses $100 whenever gold rises or falls $1 per ounce. Gary plans to risk $300, plus commission and slippage. The 2% Rule allows him to risk a maximum of $400. The 2% Rule allows him to take that trade. Gary is aiming for a $900 profit, risking $300. Those are good odds, but his plan illustrates how hard it is to trade a small account. A mere $3 move against him puts him near the limit of his risk tolerance. He may want to look into trading smaller minicontracts. 130 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Answer 75 No. Give yourself three points for choosing the right answer. The 2% Rule limits Susan’s maximum allowed risk to $1,000. Risking $2.50 per share on 500 shares would expose $1,250 to risk, plus commissions and slippage. This trade would violate the 2% Rule. Susan has to reduce the number of shares she’ll buy. If a proven system gives her this trade, she should take it, but on a smaller scale—300 shares rather than 500. Answer 76 Choice 3 is correct. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. All of the choices given are helpful, but none compares in importance with having a boss whose main tasks are money management and discipline. People who trade well for institutions can rarely match their performance level once they leave to trade for themselves, because they leave the manager behind. A private trader has to be his own manager, which is why it is essential to write down your trading plans and rate yourself on your adherence to them. Answer 77 Choice 2 is correct.
