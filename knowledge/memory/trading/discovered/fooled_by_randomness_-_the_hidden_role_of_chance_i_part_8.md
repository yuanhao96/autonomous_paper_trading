Chapter 5. My aim, as a pure amateur fleeing the boredom of business life, was merely to develop intuitions for these events - the sort of intuitions that amateurs build away from the overly detailed sophistication of the professional researcher. I also toyed with molecular biology, generating randomly occurring cancer cells and witnessing some surprising aspects to their evolution. Naturally the analogue to fabricating populations of Zorglubs was to simulate a population of "idiotic bull", "impetuous bear" and "cautious" traders under different market regimes, say booms and busts, and to examine their short-term and long-term survival. Under such a structure, "idiotic bull" traders who get rich from the rally would use the proceeds to buy more assets, driving prices higher, until their ultimate shellacking. A MATHEMATICAL MEDITATION ON HISTORY 47 Bearish traders, though, rarely made it in the boom to get to the bust. My models showed almost nobody to really ultimately make money; bears dropped out like flies in the rally and bulls got ultimately slaughtered, as paper profits vanished when the music stopped. But there was one exception; some of those who traded options (I called them option buyers) had remarkable staying power and I wanted to be one of those. How? Because they could buy the insurance against blowup; they could get anxiety-free sleep at night, thanks to the knowledge that if their careers were threatened, it would not be owing to the outcome of a single day. If the tone of this book seems steeped in the culture of Darwinism and evolutionary thinking, it does not come from any remotely formal training in the natural sciences, but from the evolutionary way of thinking taught by my Monte Carlo simulators. I have to reckon that I outgrew the desire to generate random runs every time I want to explore an idea - but by dint of playing with a Monte Carlo engine for years I can no longer visualize a realized outcome without reference to the non-realized ones. I call that "summing under histories", borrowing the expression from the colorful physicist Richard Feynman who applied such methods to examine the dynamics of particles. Using my Monte Carlo to do and redo history reminded me of the experimental novels (the so-called new novels) by such writers as Alain Robbe-Grillet, popular in the 1960s and 1970s. There the same chapter would be written and revised, the writer each time changing the plot like a new sample path. Somehow the author was freed from the past situation he helped create and allowed himself the indulgence to change the plot retroactively. denigration of history One more word on history seen from a Monte Carlo perspective. The wisdom of such classical stories as Solon prods me to spend even more time in the company of the classical historians, even if the stories, like Solon's warning, have benefited from the patina of time. However, this goes against the grain: learning from history does not come naturally to 48 SOLON'S WARNING us humans, a fact that is so visible in the endless repetitions of identically configured booms and busts in modern markets. By history I refer to the anecdotes, not the historical theorizing, the -grand-scale historicism that aims to interpret events with theories based on uncovering some laws in the evolution of history - the sort of Hegelianism and pseudoscientific historicism leading to such calls as the end of history (it is pseudoscientific because it draws theories from past events without allowing for the fact that such combinations of events might have arisen from randomness; it is mostly pseudoscientific because there is no way to verify the claims in a controlled experiment2). It is merely at the level of my desired sensibility, affecting the way I would wish to think by reference to past events, by being able to better steal the ideas of others and leverage them, correct the mental defect that seems to block my ability to learn from others. It is the respect of the elders that I would like to develop, reinforcing the awe I instinctively feel for people with gray hair, but that has eroded in my life as a trader where age and success are somewhat divorced. Indeed, I have two ways of learning from history: from the past by reading the elders, and from the future thanks to my Monte Carlo toy. t h e s t o v e is h o t As I mentioned above, it is not natural for us to learn from history. We have enough clues to believe that our genetic endowment as homo erectus does not favor transfers of experience. It is a platitude that children learn only from their own mistakes; they will cease to touch a burning stove only when they are themselves burned; no possible warning by others can lead to developing the smallest form of cautiousness. Adults, too, suffer from such a condition. This point has been examined by behavioral economics pioneers Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky with regards to the choices people make in selecting risky medical treatments - I myself have seen it in my being extremely lax in the area of detection and prevention (i.e., I refuse to derive my risks from the probabilities computed on others, feeling that I am somewhat special) yet extremely aggressive in the treatment of medical conditions (I overreact when I am burned), which is not coherent with A MATHEMATICAL MEDITATION ON HISTORY 49 rational behavior under uncertainty. This congenital denigration of the experience of others is not limited to children or to people like myself; it affects business decision makers and investors on a grand scale. All of my colleagues whom I have known to denigrate history blew up spectacularly - and I have yet to encounter some such person who has not blown up. But the truly interesting point lies in the remarkable similarities in their approaches. I have noticed plenty of analogies between those who blew up in the stock market crash of 1987, those who blew up in the Japan meltdown of 1990, those who blew up in the bond market debacle
