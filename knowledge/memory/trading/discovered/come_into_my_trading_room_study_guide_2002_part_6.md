Chapter 6 (pages 134–153). Additional Materials Appel, Gerald. Day-Trading with Gerald Appel (video) (New York: Financial Trading, Inc., 1989). S E V E N ADVANCED CONCEPTS Answer 54 1. E 2. B 3. D 4. F 5. A 6. C Give yourself a point for each correct answer. The slope of the EMA reflects the direction of market inertia, whereas the slope of MACD-Histogram shows the direction of market momentum. Combining the messages of these two indicators is the key principle of the Impulse System. The longer you wait to recognize a splash of momentum, the lower the profitability. Taking profits and jumping out of successful trades is the hardest psychological factor of momentum trading. Answer 55 1. D, F 2. A, B, C, E, G, H 119 120 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Give yourself a point for each correctly identified cluster. Add two points if you got the bonus question right, or a point for getting it partly right. Buy signals emerge when both the EMA and MACD-Histogram are rising together; sell signals emerge when both are falling. The weekly uptrend (not shown) gives extra weight to bullish signals. Bearish clusters show reactions against the uptrend, but once those signals cease, the uptrend embarks on its sharpest upmoves. At the right edge of the chart—neutral. The trend is getting old, and MACD-Histogram is weakening. Tighten stops on long positions. Answer 56 1. E 2. B, C, F, G 3. A 4. C 5. B, D 6. D-G Give yourself a point for each correct answer (half a point if you missed one of several occurrences). Add two points if you got the bonus question right, or a point for getting it partly right. The day begins with a string of shorting signals: a downward gap, followed by a cluster of Impulse sell signals, followed by a downside breakout from the opening range, and then more Impulse sell signals. The deepening bottoms of MACD-Histogram call for lower prices ahead. The best day-trading opportunities tend to present themselves in the beginning of the session, although the Impulse System continues to give sell signals throughout the day. At point G prices sink to a new low, but MACD-Histogram completes a bullish divergence—the last call to take profits on intraday shorts. ADVANCED CONCEPTS 121 At the right edge of the chart—neutral. The trend is down and prices are weak and closing near the lows, but there is a bullish divergence. Tomorrow check the 25-minute chart and be ready to follow the first cluster of the Impulse System signals. Answer 57 B. 1 and 2. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. Most people are more objective when they do not have money at risk. Before he enters a trade, a rational trader estimates his profit as well as his risk, compares them and makes his go–no go decision. He tries to select trades in which he stands to win more than he risks—the higher the ratio, the better. If the exit target is at a channel line, that target will move with the passage of time, but it is important to have a general idea where it is before you enter. Answer 58 C. 1, 2, and 3. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. One of the few statistically proven market behaviors is the tendency of prices to fluctuate above and below value. Channels help identify manic levels for selling longs and going short and depressed levels for covering shorts and going long. Before putting on a trade, make sure that the channel is wide enough to be worth trading. A well-drawn channel contains about 95% of prices, but no channel is perfect. Some price swings are so strong that they punch out of the channel, whereas others are too weak to reach it. 122 ANSWERS AND RATING SCALES Answer 59 1. A, C, D 2. B, E Give yourself a point for each correctly identified signal. Add two points if you got the bonus question right, or a point for getting it partly right. When prices hit the upper line of a well-drawn channel, they reveal market mania and give a sell signal. You can place your sell order in advance, at the channel line. If you are in front of the screen during the day, you may wait for prices to punch above that line and then exit when prices fail to make a new high for the day or, as a fallback, when they weaken and hit the channel wall from above. The time to cover shorts is when prices hit the lower channel wall. Notice a beautiful buy signal between points C and D. Prices came back to touch the EMA before embarking on their most dynamic rally. The only way to have caught that buy signal was to estimate tomorrow’s EMA value each day and place a buy order there for the day ahead. At the right edge of the chart—bullish. The EMA has ticked up, and prices straddle the EMA, offering a value trade. It is time to buy and be ready to take profits near the upper channel line. Answer 60 True 1, 4, 5 False 2, 3 Give yourself a point for each correct answer. Stops must be defined by both technical analysis and money management and placed immediately after entering a trade. Most traders should place actual stop orders: only the pros of proven discipline may use mental stops. Relying on so-called advanced analysis instead of stops is a sign of arrogance that has been the undoing of countless traders. ADVANCED CONCEPTS 123 Answer 61 1. B 2. E 3. D 4. C 5. A 6. F Give yourself a point for each correct answer. Market noise is the extent by which today’s extreme price extends outside yesterday’s extreme—the high in downtrends, the low in uptrends. Average Penetration is the average level of market noise during the lookback period. We multiply Average Upside Penetration by the coefficient and add it to the highs to place stops in downtrends, or multiply Average Downside Penetration by the coefficient and subtract it from the lows to place stops in uptrends. Answer 62 D. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Give yourself four points for choosing the right answer. Margin works great when you’re right, but hits you even harder on losing trades. It raises the cost of trading, as well as the stress level, because with margin you trade
