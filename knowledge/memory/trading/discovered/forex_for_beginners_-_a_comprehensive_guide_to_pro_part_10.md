Chapter 1 | Historical Background primarily through proprietary systems operated by individual banks or multibank trading systems. Of course, some of this volume is transacted as legitimate cross-border investment. When a corporation invests in an overseas project, it is practicing what is referred to as foreign direct investment (FDI). When an investment fund buys shares of stock or bonds that trade on an overseas exchange, this is known as portfolio investment. Such investments necessarily involve foreign currency exchange. However, an increasing amount of institutional volume is being transacted in the form of high-frequency and/or algorithmic trading. Hedge funds in particular have become notorious for their reliance on placing millions of rapid-fire trades every day, through systems that are largely automated. They seek to profit from miniscule changes in exchange rates and minute discrepancies in exchange rates across different trading centers, both of which might occur in less than a second. Known as forex arbitrage, this strategy typically involves buying a block of currency on one exchange and immediately reselling it for a slight profit (less than one PIP) on another exchange. High-frequency trading already accounts for an estimated 30% of overall forex volume (compared to 66% of equities trading volume) and is expected to account for a majority of volume as soon as 2012.4 On some exchanges, algorithmic (also known as computerized) trading accounts for 45% of total volume.

Relationship of forex participants High-frequency trading might explain most of the growth in overall volume that took place over the last three years, and its use may continue to set the pace for growth going forward. Naturally, this has spurred an arms race among market participants to develop the fastest networks and most sophisticated software. Many commentators have lamented this phenomenon. To be sure, highfrequency trading is probably responsible for increased volatility. In addition, the sophistication of institutional trading algorithms has made it more difficult for amateur traders to profit from technical analysis strategies. On the other hand, hedge funds have become a great source of liquidity, driving execution times and spreads down to record low levels. Besides, as I’ll explain in the chapters that follow, it’s possible to craft a trading strategy that takes this trend into account. Retail Brokers and Retail Traders As forex becomes increasingly mainstream, more amateur and professional investors are rushing to join in. Households and small non-bank institutions now account for an estimated $300 billion in global forex volume, representing close to 10% of overall volume and market growth of 400% 17 18
