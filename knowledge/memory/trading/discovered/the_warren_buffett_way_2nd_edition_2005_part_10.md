Chapter 8. Buying an underwear maker creates lots of opportunities for corny jokes, and Buffett, an accomplished punster, made the most of it. At the 2002 shareholders meeting, when asked the obvious question, he teased the audience with a half answer: “When I wear underwear at all, which I rarely do . . .” Leaving the crowd to decide for themselves whether it’s boxers or briefs for Buffett. He pointed out why there’s “a favorable bottom line” in underwear: “It’s an elastic market.” Finally, he deadpanned, Charlie Munger had given him an additional reason to buy the company: “For years Charlie has been telling me, ‘Warren, we have to get into women’s underwear.’ Charlie is 78. It’s now or never.”8 another, a company that must integrate and manage a new business is apt to make mistakes that could be costly to shareholders. In Buffett’s mind, the only reasonable and responsible course for companies that have a growing pile of cash that cannot be reinvested at above-average rates is to return that money to the shareholders. For that, two methods are available: raising the dividend or buying back shares. With cash in hand from their dividends, shareholders have the opportunity to look elsewhere for higher returns. On the surface, this seems to be a good deal, and therefore many people view increased dividends as a sign of companies that are doing well. Buffett believes that this is so only if investors can get more for their cash than the company could generate if it retained the earnings and reinvested in the company. Over the years, Berkshire Hathaway has earned very high returns from its capital and has retained all its earnings. With such high returns, shareholders would have been ill served if they were paid a dividend. Not surprisingly, Berkshire does not pay a dividend. And that’s just fine 90 T H E W A R R E N B U F F E T T W AY with the shareholders. The ultimate test of owners’ faith is allowing management to reinvest 100 percent of earnings; Berkshire’s owners’ faith in Buffett is high. If the real value of dividends is sometimes misunderstood, the second mechanism for returning earnings to the shareholders—stock repurchase—is even more so. The benefit to the owners is in many respects less direct, less tangible, and less immediate. When management repurchases stock, Buffett feels that the reward is twofold. If the stock is selling below its intrinsic value, then purchasing shares makes good business sense. If a company’s stock price is $50 and its intrinsic value is $100, then each time management buys its stock, they are acquiring $2 of intrinsic value for every $1 spent. Such transactions can be highly profitable for the remaining shareholders. Furthermore, says Buffett, when executives actively buy the company’s stock in the market, they are demonstrating that they have the best interests of their owners at hand rather than a careless need to expand the corporate structure. That kind of stance sends good signals to the market, attracting other investors looking for a well-managed company that increases shareholders’ wealth. Frequently, shareholders are rewarded twice; first from the initial open market purchase and then subsequently from the positive effect of investor interest on price. Coca-Cola Growth in net cash f low has allowed Coca-Cola to increase its dividend to shareholders and also repurchase its shares in the open market. In 1984, the company authorized its first-ever buyback, announcing it would repurchase 6 million shares of stock. Since then, the company has repurchased more than 1 billion shares. This represented 32 percent of the shares outstanding as of January 1, 1984, at an average price per share of $12.46. In other words, the company spent approximately $12.4 billion to buy in shares that only ten years later would have a market value of approximately $60 billion. In July 1992, the company announced that through the year 2000, it would buy back 100 million shares of its stock, representing 7.6 percent of the company’s outstanding shares. Remarkably, because of its strong cash-generating abilities, the company was able to accomplish this while it continued its aggressive investment in overseas markets.
