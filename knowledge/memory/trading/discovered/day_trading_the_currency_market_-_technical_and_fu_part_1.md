Chapter 2), but in a nutshell, in 1990 the U.K. decided to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System in order to take part in the low-inflationary yet stable economy generated by the Germany’s central bank, which is also known as the Bundesbank. This alliance tied the pound to the deutsche mark, which meant that the U.K. was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the Bundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to avoid the inflationary effects related to German reunification. However, national pride and the commitment of fixing exchange rates within the ERM prevented the U.K. from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, 1992, also known as Black Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and sold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the Exchange Rate Mechanism. This essentially “broke” the Bank of England and forced the devaluation of its currency. In a matter of 24 hours, the British pound fell approximately 5 percent or 5,000 pips. The Bank of England promised to raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, the bond markets also experienced tremendous volatility, with the one-month U.K. London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) increasing 1 percent and then retracing the gain over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were completely oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they probably would have found themselves dumbstruck in the face of such a rapid gyration in yields. 5 Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds For U.S. government bond traders, there has also been a brewing issue that has made it imperative to learn to monitor the developments in the currency markets. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of speculation about the possible revaluation of the Chinese yuan. Despite strong economic growth and a trade surplus with many countries, China has artificially maintained its currency within a tight trading band in order to ensure the continuation of rapid growth and modernization. This has caused extreme opposition from manufacturers and government officials from countries around the world, including the United States and Japan. It is estimated that China’s fixed exchange rate regime has artificially kept the yuan 15 percent to 40 percent below its true value. In order to maintain a weak currency and keep the exchange rate within a tight band, the Chinese government has to sell the yuan and buy U.S. dollars each time its currency appreciates above the band’s upper limit. China then uses these dollars to purchase U.S. Treasuries. This practice has earned China the status of being the world’s second largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. Its demand has kept U.S. interest rates at historical lows. Even though China has made some changes to their currency regime, since then, the overall revaluation was modest, which means more is set to come. More revaluation spells trouble for the U.S. bond market, since it means that a big buyer may be pulling away. An announcement of this sort could send yields soaring and prices tumbling. Therefore, in order for bond traders to effectively manage risk, it is also important for them to follow the developments in the currency markets so that a shock of this type does not catch them by surprise. COMPARING THE FX MARKET WITH FUTURES AND EQUITIES Traditionally FX has not been the most popular market to trade because access to the foreign exchange market was primarily restricted to hedge funds, Commodity Trading Advisors who manage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors due to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. One of the primary reasons why the foreign exchange market has traditionally been the market of choice for these large players is because the risk that a trader takes is fully customizable. That is, one trader could use a hundred times leverage while another may choose to not be leveraged at all. However, in recent years many firms have opened up the foreign exchange market to retail traders, providing leveraged trading as well as free instantaneous execution platforms, charts, and real-time news. As a result, foreign exchange trading has surged in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class to trade. Many equity and futures traders have begun to add currencies into the mix of products that they trade or have even switched to trading currencies exclusively. The reason why this trend is emerging is because these traders are beginning to realize that there are many attractive attributes to trading FX over equities or futures. FX versus Equities Here are some of the key attributes of trading spot foreign exchange compared to the equities market. 6 FX Market Key Attributes • Foreign exchange is the largest market in the world and has growing liquidity. • There is 24-hour around-the-clock trading. • Traders can profit in both bull and bear markets. • Short selling is permitted without an uptick, and there are no trading curbs. • Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors. • Even though higher leverage increases risk, many traders see trading the FX market as getting more bang for the buck.
