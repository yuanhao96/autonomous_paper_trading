Chapter 1 The Covered-Write Synthetic: Two or more trading vehicles (for example, call, put, and underlying) packaged together to emulate another trading vehicle or spread. Some examples: (long call  long put  long underlying) (short call  short put  short underlying) (long put  long call  short underlying) (short put  short call  long underlying) (long underlying  long call  short put) (short underlying  short call  long put) Conversion: A position that consists of a long underlying, a short call, and a long put with the same strike price, which is considered a market neutral position. Vertical spread: The simultaneous purchase and sale of options of the same class and with the same expiration times but with different strike prices. Depending on which strike is bought and which strike is sold, vertical spreads can be either bullish or bearish. For example, with XYZ July 100/105 call vertical spread, a bullish trader would buy the 100 call and sell the 105 call, whereas a bearish trader would buy the 105 call and sell the 100 call. STRATEGY OVERVIEW A covered-write is a strategy that combines a long stock position and a short call (Figure 1.1). In options parlance a written option is an option that is sold, in this case a call, and a short call is covered by a long stock 8 Long Stock 6 Short Call 4 Profit/Loss 4 2 0 –2 –4 –6 –8 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 Underlying Price Figure 1.1 Components of a Covered-Write P&L Diagram 50 51 52 Strategy Composition position, hence the name covered-write. The calls are sold in equal amounts against the long underlying shares. In the United States, the contract size of a stock option is usually 100 shares; therefore, one call would be sold against 100 shares, five calls against 500 shares, and so on. The strike price and expiration date of the call(s) chosen can vary depending on the investment objective, market view, and risk appetite of the investor, as well as the pricing of the calls themselves. STRATEGY COMPOSITION Components: Sell one 45 call at $2.25 Purchase 100 shares of XYZ stock at $45.00 Maximum Profit: Limited to the premium received for the sale of the call, plus any increase in value of the underlying up to the strike price of the short call ($2.25) Maximum Loss: Substantial loss on the downside for the long underlying position (limited by zero), less the premium received for the sale of the call Breakeven: Price paid for the underlying minus the premium received for the sale of the call ($42.75) The writing of a call against a long stock position serves two purposes: It generates potential income and provides some downside protection. However, in return, the investor gives away any upside price appreciation in the stock above the strike price. • Income Generation The price of an option has two components, intrinsic value and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is the amount, if any, that the option is “in the money.” A call option is in-the-money if the stock price is higher than the strike price. Any remaining value is extrinsic value. Extrinsic value is the additional premium carried by an option based on many factors including, but not limited to, interest rate levels, dividend flows, time to expiration, and implied volatility levels. The extrinsic value of an option declines as time passes, and upon expiration it is gone entirely. This phenomenon is known as time decay (see Figure 1.2). Sellers of options benefit from time decay (which is referred to as the Greek “theta”) as the extrinsic value in an option declines over time. This provides income for the investor in a covered-write strategy, as over time the extrinsic value of the written (sold) call will decline. • Downside Protection Writing a call also offers some downside protection for the long stock position, as the premium(s) collected from selling the call can partially 5 6
