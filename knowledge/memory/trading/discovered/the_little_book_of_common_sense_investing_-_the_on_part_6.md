And that return turns out to be far lower.  Hint: money flows into most funds after good performance, and goes out when bad performance follows. To ascertain the return earned by the average fund investor, we must consider the dollar-weighted return, which accounts for the impact of capital flows from investors, into and out of the fund.* (Hint: money flows into most funds after good performance is achieved, and goes out when bad performance follows.) When we compare traditionally calculated fund returns with the returns actually earned by their investors * If a $100 million fund earns a return of 30 percent during a given year and $1 billion of its shares are purchased on the final day of the year, the average return earned by its investors would be just 4.9 percent.
