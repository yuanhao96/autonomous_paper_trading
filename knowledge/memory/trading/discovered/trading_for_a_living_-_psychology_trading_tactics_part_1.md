Section 7). Markets offer unlimited opportunities for self-sabotage, as well as for self-fulfillment. Acting out your internal conflicts in the marketplace is a very expensive proposition. Traders who are not at peace with themselves often try to fulfill their contradictory wishes in the market. If you do not know where you are going, you will wind up somewhere you never wanted to be. 5. FANTASY VERSUS REALITY If you hear from a friend with little farming experience that he plans to feed himself with food grown on a quarter-acre plot, you will expect him to go hungry. We all know that one can squeeze only so much blood from a turnip. The one field in which grown-ups let their fantasies soar is trading. Just the other day, a friend told me that he expected to support himself trading his $6000 account. When I tried to show him the futility of his plan, he quickly changed our topic of conversation. He is a bright analyst, but he refuses to see that his "intensive farming" plan is suicidal. In his desperate effort to succeed, he must take on large positions-and the slightest wiggle of the market is sure to put him out of business. A successful trader is a realist. He knows his abilities and limitations. He sees what is happening in the markets and knows how to react to them. He 5. FANTASY VERSUS REALITY 13 I analyzes the markets without cutting comers, observes his own reactions, and makes realistic plans. A professional trader cannot afford illusions. Once an amateur takes a few hits and gets a few margin calls, he becomes fearful instead of cocky and starts developing strange ideas about the markets. Losers buy, sell, or miss trades thanks to their fantastic ideas. They act like children who are afraid to pass a cemetery or look under their bed at night because they are afraid of ghosts. The unstructured environment of the market makes it is easy to develop fantasies. Most people who have grown up in Western civilization have several similar fantasies. They are so widespread that when I studied at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, there was a course called "Universal Fantasies." For example, most people have a fantasy in childhood that they were adopted rather than born to their parents. A fantasy seems to explain the unfriendly and impersonal world. It consoles a child but prevents him from seeing reality. Our fantasies influence our behavior, even if we are not consciously aware of them. In talking to hundreds of traders, I keep hearing them express several universal fantasies. They distort reality and stand in the way of trading success. A successful trader must identify his fantasies and get rid of them. The Brain Myth Losers who suffer from the "brain myth" will tell you, "I lost because I didn't know trading secrets." Many losers have a fantasy that successful traders have some secret knowledge. This fantasy helps support a lively market in advisory services and ready-made trading systems. A demoralized trader often whips out his checkbook and goes shopping for "trading secrets." He may send money to a charlatan for a $3000 "can't miss," backtested, computerized trading system. When that self-destructs, he sends another check for a "scientific manual" that explains how he can stop being a loser and become a true insider and a winner by contetnplating the Moon, Saturn, or even Uranus. The losers do not know that trading is intellectually fairly simple. It is less demanding than taking out an appendix, building a bridge, or trying a case in court. Good traders are often shrewd, but few of them are intellectuals. Many have not been to college, and some have even dropped out of high school. Intelligent and hardworking people who have succeeded in their careers often feel drawn to trading. The average client of a brokerage firm is 50 14 INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY years old, is married, and has a college education. Many have postgraduate degrees or own their businesses. The two largest professional groups among traders are engineers and farmers. Why do these intelligent and hardworking people fail in trading? What separates winners from losers is neither intelligence nor secrets, and certainly not education. The Undercapitalization Myth Many losers think that they would be successful if they could trade a bigger account. All losers get knocked out of the game by a string of losses or a single abysmally bad trade. Often, after the amateur is sold out, the market reverses and moves in the direction he expected. The loser is ready to kick either himself or his broker: Had he survived another week, he might have made a small fortune! Losers take this reversal as a confirmation of their methods. They earn, save, or borrow enough money to open another small account. The story repeats: The loser gets wiped out, the market reverses and "proves" the loser right, but only too late - he has been sold out again. That's when the fantasy is born: "If only I had a bigger account, I could have stayed in the market a little longer and won." Some losers raise money from relatives and friends by showing them a paper track record. It seems to prove that they would have won big, if only they had had more money to work with. But if they raise more money, they lose that, too - it is as if the market were laughing at them! A loser is not undercapitalized - his mind is underdeveloped. A loser can destroy a big account almost as quickly as a small one. He overtrades, and his money management is sloppy. He takes risks that are too big, whatever the size of his account. No matter how good his system is, a streak of bad trades is sure to put him out of business. Traders often ask me how much money they need to begin trading. They want to be able to withstand a drawdown, a temporary drop in the account equity. They expect to lose a large amount of money before making any! They sound like an engineer who plans to build several bridges that collapse before erecting his masterpiece. Would a surgeon plan on killing several
