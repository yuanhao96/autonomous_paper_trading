CHAPTER 1 WHAT YOU MUST KNOW TO GET STARTED 9 purchase of a particular share when in fact such share will fall based on rumors of a takeover of one company by another. In the FOREX market, analysts just base their studies on the market and are not influenced by rumors of purchase. This is a market that generates billions of dollars a day for banks and certainly is necessary for the success of global markets. Four currencies against thousands of shares. In the FOREX market, there are six major pairs, whereas in the stock market, there are thousands of companies. So analyzing four key pairs is much easier than analyzing thousands of companies. In the FOREX, obviously there are more than a hundred pairs, but those that are the most subject to transactions include only six major pairs. FOREX VERSUS FUTURES Is there a significant difference between trading futures and FOREX? The FOREX operates at a higher volume, thus offering better liquidity. As I have said, the FOREX is the market with more volume, which already operates daily with highs peaking close to US $6 trillion in turn over a day and an average near US $3 trillion a day in turn over. This market can absorb the volume of that daily operation. The futures market, on the other hand, operates with approximately US $30 billion a day. This is nothing compared with US$3 trillion. This is why the futures market has limited liquidity, whereas the FOREX market always has complete liquidity, which tells us that sales or purchases can be settled at any time or stop losses can jump without affecting the market in volatile conditions. It must be said that the FOREX is more than 45 times bigger than all the combined futures markets. The FOREX is a 24-hour market. This is precisely the major disadvantage of the futures market. The FOREX is a 24-hour nonstop market, but the futures market is open only for 7 hours. Therefore, FOREX traders have the ability to react to news that arises elsewhere, whereas futures traders have to wait for the opening of the daily meeting. No commissions are involved. In the FOREX, the broker earns money from the spreads that the broker provides. The intermediary is eliminated, and the transactions are being done online through the platform provided by the broker or by telephone. Logically, the FOREX TRADING SECRETS 10 broker assumes the spread, which is the difference between the bid and ask prices. In the futures market, on the other hand, a certain commission has to be paid to the broker. Some brokers in the FOREX are starting to charge commissions so that they can provide the tightest spreads possible. It really is a preference, but the bottom line is that the broker will make money somehow. After all, that is why they are in the business. The price is known, and the execution is instantaneous. In a FOREX transaction, the price that the trader sees at the moment is the price that he or she will get; orders are executed instantaneously under normal market conditions. On the other hand, in the futures market, the order is not executed immediately. Sometimes the price does not reflect the current market price, but the price of the final purchase price will not necessarily be the one at which the trader is buying. There is a guarantee of limited risk. In the FOREX, traders can limit their risk of losses. The risk is minimized by the platform, which automatically generates a margin call if the margin required exceeds the available capital in your account. Futures losses are always a possibility; a position can be closed with losses, and therefore, you may have a deficit in your account and incur a debt. Keep in mind that there is always a potential to lose money trading. All the futures commission merchants (FCMs) will provide you with disclaimers, which they are required by law to provide. I have been trading in the FOREX for many years, and I have never had or seen a negative account in the spot FOREX owing to a margin call. The main advantages of the FOREX versus futures include the following: Advantage FOREX Futures 24-Hour market No commissions Instant execution Leverage to 400:1 Known price Limited risk Yes Yes* Yes Yes Yes Yes No No No No No No *Some exceptions. C H 2 A P T E R MAJOR CURRENCIES AND PAIRS THE U.S. DOLLAR The U.S. dollar (USD) is the base or quote currency with the following FOREX major currency pairs: USD/JPY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD. Additionally, the USD is the base currency and is paired with the following currencies: NOK, SEK, SGD, DKK, CNY, MXN, BRL, ZAR, and other exotic currencies depending on each broker’s availability. The USD (also abbreviated $) is the official currency used in the United States of America. It is considered the standard currency unit that is used in commodity markets across the globe (especially gold and crude oil markets). It also is currently the most employed reserve currency in the world. This allows the country to hold trade deficits with other countries without experiencing depreciation. The volatility of the currency is usually low to medium. The economy of the United States has the strongest influence on the rest of the world, especially in the computer technology, medical, aerospace, and military fields. It is principally market-oriented; thus corporations and private businesses lead in decision making. 11 12 FOREX TRADING SECRETS THE EURO The euro (or EUR) is the base or quote currency with the following FOREX major and crossed-rate currency pairs: EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, EUR/GBP, EUR/CHF, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD. Additionally, the EUR is the base currency and is paired with the following currencies: NOK, SEK, SGD, DKK, CNY, MXN, BRL, ZAR, and other exotic currencies depending on each broker’s availability. The euro is the currency that is actually used in most member countries of the European Union. It was created in 1999 and implemented in 2002 and represents the result of the most important monetary reform on the entire conti
