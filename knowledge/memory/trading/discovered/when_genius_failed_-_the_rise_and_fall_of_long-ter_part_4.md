Komansky's number two, asked Cayne where he stood. Cayne stated his position clearly: Bear Stearns would not invest a nickel in Long-Term Capital. For a moment the bankers, the cream of Wall Street, were silent. And then the room exploded. Komansky recognized that executive, would be a pivotal THE RISE LONG-TERI\177 CAPITAI MANAGEMEN'I MERIWETHER WASBrothers, one article of faithto ride that your John losses Meriwether ,at THERE Salomon it was until discovered they turned to pinpoint the moment of Meriwether's revelation. In t979, a securities dealer named J. E Eckstein & Co. was on the brink of failing. A panicked Eckstein went to Salomon and met with a group that included several of Salomon'spartners and also Meriwether, then a cherub-faced trader of thirty-one. \"I got a great trade, but 1 can't stay in it,\" Eckstein pleaded with them. \"How about buying me out?\" The situation was this: Eckstein traded in Treasury bill futures-which, as the name suggests,are contracts that provide for the delivery of U.S. Treasury bills, at a fixed price in the future. They often traded at a slight discount to the price of the actual, underlying bills. In a classic bit of arbitrage, Eckstein would buy the futures, sell the bills, and then wait for the two prices to converge. Since most people would pay about the same to own a bill in the proximate future as they would to own it now, it was reasonable to think that the prices would converge. And there was a bit of magic in the trade, which was the secret of Eckstein's business, of Long-TermCapital's future busi'F into gains.

But as long as the cheaper asset--the futures--rose by a little more (or fell by a little less) than did the bills, Eckstein's profit on his winning trade would be greater than his loss on the other side. This is the basic idea of arbitrage. Eckstein had made this bet many times, typically with success. As he made more mone,v, he gradually raised his stake. For some reason, in June 1979, the normal pattern was reversed: futures got more expensive than bills. Confident that the customary relationship would reassert itself, Eckstein put on a very big trade. But instead of converging, the gap widened even further. Eckstem was hit with massive margin calls and became desperateto sell. Meriwether, as it had happened, had recently set up a bondarbitrage group within Salomon. He instantly saw that Eckstein's trade made
