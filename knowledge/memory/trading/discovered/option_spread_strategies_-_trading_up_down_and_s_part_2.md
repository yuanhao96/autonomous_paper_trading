Chapter 1 The Covered-Write Extrinsic Value Expiration Time Figure 1.2 Extrinsic Value Diagram offset a decline in the stock price. However, this protection is only equal to the amount of the premium collected when the call was written. Once the magnitude of the stock decline exceeds the premium collected, the protection ends. • Upside Limitations A covered-write is a neutral to mildly bullish strategy. The reason it is only a mildly bullish strategy is that the profit potential of the position to the upside is limited by the short call. If the stock price rises above the strike price, the short call becomes in-the-money and begins to accumulate intrinsic value as the stock price rises, eventually offsetting any gains in the stock with losses in the short call. Also, if the stock rises above the strike price and the investor takes no action, it is likely for the stock to be “called away” by the owner of the call. This may have unpleasant tax consequences that should be considered. Modifications In the event that the underlying stock falls too far, or rises too high, modifications to the position will have to be made to either limit risk, as in the case of the former, or extend the range of profitability, as in the case of the latter. We will discuss modifications later in the chapter. These modifications may increase execution costs, affecting profitability. RISK MANAGEMENT: THE GREEKS OF THE COVERED-WRITE The “Greeks” are metrics used to quantify the sensitivity of option prices to changes in underlying market conditions. They can be effective risk management tools and are especially helpful for understanding and managing the risk of positions. They can also be applied to positions that are combinations of options and underlying positions, such as a The Greeks covered-write. To evaluate the sensitivity of a position to changing market conditions, the Greeks of the various components of the position are simply summed, giving an aggregate exposure for the position. It must be understood, however, that as market conditions change, the Greeks themselves also change, so the Greeks of any position are in a constant state of flux. Basic pricing models calculate the theoretical price of an option based on six inputs used to describe market conditions: • Underlying price • Strike price • Time to expiration • Interest rates • Dividends (if any) • Implied volatility Since a covered-write position is part option and part stock, it is the Greeks of the option component of the position that will change; the Greeks of the stock component of the position will remain constant. A brief review of the basic Greeks follows, to help the reader understand how a coveredwrite position behaves as market conditions change. THE GREEKS Delta Delta describes the sensitivity (rate of change) of an option’s price with respect to changes in the underlying price. Expressed as a percentage, it represents an equivalent amount of the underlying at a given moment in time. Calls are assigned a positive delta (call option prices are positively correlated with the underlying price); puts are assigned a negative delta (put option prices are negatively correlated with the underlying price). The delta of a call option can range between 0.00 (0 percent) and 1.00 (100 percent), while the delta of a put option can range between 0.00 (0 percent) and 1.00 (100 percent). (See Figures 1.3 and 1.4.) A short position in any of the above call or put options reverses the delta; for example, a short call will have a negative delta and a short put will have a positive delta.
