Chapter 1 brings home the central reality of investing: “The most that owners in the aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their business in the aggregate earns,” in the words of Warren Buffett. Illustrating the point with Berkshire Hathaway, the publicly owned investment company he has run for 40 years, Buffett says, “When the stock temporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number of shareholders— either sellers or buyers—receive out-sized benefits at the expense of those they trade with. [But] o ve r time, the [10] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING aggregate gains made by Berkshire shareholders must o f necessity matc h the business gains o f the company.”  “Over time, the aggregate gains made by shareholders must of necessity match the business gains of the company.” How often investors lose sight of that eternal principle! Yet the record is clear. History, if only we would take the trouble to look at it, reveals the remarkable, if essential, linkage between the cumulative long-term returns earned by business—the annual dividend yield plus the annual rate of earnings growth—and the cumulative returns earned by the U.S. s tock market. Think about that certainty for a moment. Can you see that it is simple common sense? Need proof? Just look at the record since the twentieth century began (Exhibit 2.1). The average annual total return on stocks was 9.6 percent, virtually identical to the investment return of 9.5 percent—4.5 percent from dividend yield and 5 percent from earnings growth. That tiny difference of 0.1 percent per year arose from what I call speculative return. Depending on how one looks at it, it is merely statistical noise, or perhaps it reflects a generally upward long-term trend in stock valuations, a willingness of investors to pay higher prices for each dollar of earnings at the end of the period than at the beginning. R AT I O N A L E X U B E R A N C E EXHIBIT 2.1 [11] Investment Return versus Market Return—Growth of $1, 1900 –2005 100,000 Dollars 10,000 1,000 Annual Growth Rate Investment Return 9.5% (earnings growth plus yield) Market Return 9.6% (includes speculative return*) 100 10 1 1909 1919 1929 1939 1949 1959 1969 1979 1989 1999 *Impact of change in price-earnings ratio. Compounding these returns over 106 years produced accumulations that are truly staggering. Each dollar initially invested in 1900 at an investment return of 9.5 percent grew by the close of 2005 to $15,062.* Sure, few (if any) of us have 106 years in us, but, like the Gotrocks family over the generations, the miracle of compounding returns is little short of amazing—it is perhaps the ultimate winner’s game. * But let’s be fair. If we compound that initial $1, not at the nominal return of 9.5 percent but at the real (after-inflation) rate of 6.5 percent, the accumulation grows to $793. But increasing real wealth nearly 800 times over is not to be sneezed at. [12] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING As Exhibit 2.1 makes clear, there are bumps along the way in the investment returns earned by our business corporations. Sometimes, as in the Great Depression of the early 1930s, these bumps are large. But we get over them. So, if you stand back from the chart and squint your eyes, the trend of business fundamentals looks almost like a straight line sloping gently upward, and those periodic bumps are barely visible. Stock market returns sometimes get well ahead of business fundamentals (as in the late 1920s, the early 1970s, the late 1990s). But it has been only a matter of time until, as if drawn by a magnet, they soon return, although often only after falling well behind for a time (as in the mid-1940s, the late 1970s, the 2003 market lows). In our foolish focus on the short-term stock market distractions of the moment, we, too, often overlook this long history. We ignore that when the returns on stocks depart materially from the long-term norm, it is rarely because of the economics of investing—the earnings growth and dividend yields of our corporations. Rather, the reason that annual stock returns are so volatile is largely because of the emotions of investing. We can measure these emotions by the price/earnings (P/E) ratio, which measures the number of dollars investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. As investor confidence waxes and wanes, P/E multiples rise R AT I O N A L E X U B E R A N C E [13] and fall.* When greed holds sway, we see very high P/Es. When hope prevails, P/Es are moderate. When fear is in the saddle, P/Es are very low. Back and forth, over and over again, swings in the emotions of investors momentarily derail the steady long-range upward trend in the economics of investing.  “It is dangerous . . . to apply to the future inductive arguments based on past experience.” What Exhibit 2.1 shows is that while the prices we pay for stocks often lose touch with the reality of corporate values, in the long run, reality rules. So, while investors seem to intuitively accept that the past is inevitably prologue to the future, any past stock market returns that have included a high speculative stock return component are a deeply flawed guide to what lies ahead. To understand why past returns do not foretell the future, we need only heed the words of the great British economist John Maynard Keynes, written 70 years ago: “It is dangerous . . . to apply to the future inductive arguments based on past experience, unless one can distinguish the broad reasons why past experience was what it was.” * Changes in interest rates also have an impact, uneven though it may be, on the P/E multiple. So, I’m oversimplifying a bit here. [14] THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING But if we can distinguish the reasons the past was what it was, then, we can establish reasonable expectations about the future. Keynes helped us make this distinction by pointing out that the state of long-term expectation for stocks is a combination of en
