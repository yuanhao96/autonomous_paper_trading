Chapter 1 | Historical Background Table 1-1. Broker Amalgamation of Bid/Ask Spreads Counterparty Bid Price Bid Amount Offer Price Offer Amount JP Morgan 1.3502 $5.0 million 1.3505 $10.0 million APK Hedge Fund 1.3499 $3.0 million 1.3506 $20.0 million Joe Trader 1.3501 $1.2 million 1.3504 $7.0 million Bank of America 1.3502 $20.0 million 1.3505 $3.8 million Having received the separate quotes in Table 1-1, the broker would present the 1.3502 ($25 million) – 1.3504 ($7 million) to the customer, which represents a combination of the best bid and ask prices. (These days, this job is mostly done automatically by computers, but the principle is the same as if it were being done by hand.) Ultimately, if the seller is willing to accept a price at or below the buyer’s offer, the trade will clear. The broker will earn a profit by charging a transaction fee (expressed as a percentage of the transaction value). If the seller demands a price that is too high and/or the buyer’s offer is too low, the trade cannot be executed. Given the size of the market and the continuous volume of transactions, this is not usually an issue. The main exceptions are for unusually large orders and during moments of uncertainty, such as major news developments. During these times, the market will temporarily shrink, and spreads will widen. Those that insist on placing a trade anyway may have to accept a less favorable execution price. In practice, a forex dealer performs the same role for his clients by helping them execute trades. Unlike a broker, however, the forex dealer will actually serve as the counterparty for clients’ trades and aim to profit from favorable exchange rate movements and also by capturing the spread. Let’s consider the example above, to further elucidate this distinction. With a spread of 1.3502–1.3504, the broker will merely connect its clients with either the bid or the ask party, depending on whether they wish to buy or sell. The dealer, in contrast, will actually provide its own bid/ask spread and will fill the trade itself. It may aim to buy at 1.3502 and instantly sell at 1.3504, or it may wish to hold the position until it can earn a more substantial gain. Either way, the dealer must assume some exchange rate risk. Forex for Beginners The business model of a broker is then quite different from a dealer. Despite the conflicts of interest that the dealer model would seem to engender, however, it is not automatically clear which one is better for clients. Tiered System The forex market is divided into different tiers, access to which depends on size. The top tier is known as the interbank market (or interdealer market), where trading takes place directly between broker-dealers and other largescale liquidity providers. While interbank trading accounts for less than 20% or so of overall forex volume (Figure 1-3), it nonetheless represents the backbone of the market. Access is limited to the world’s largest banks, liquidity is nothing short of complete, and spreads are ludicrously small (less than one PIP for major currencies). Figure 1-3. Breakdown of forex market tiers These days, interdealer trading takes place almost entirely (90% plus) through electronic portals, such as Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) that include Thomson Reuters Dealing 3000, ICAP EBS, and, to a lesser extent, Bloomberg Terminal and Citigroup LAVA.2 Qualifying banks and broker-dealers pay subscription fees to the platform providers, and in exchange, are granted access to certain price data. The best prices are naturally extended to those with the best credit relationships. The ECNs do not themselves serve as brokers, but merely facilitate trading by participants. 2 Axel Pierron, Electronic Platforms in Foreign Exchange Trading (Paris: Celent, LLC, 2007). 9 10
