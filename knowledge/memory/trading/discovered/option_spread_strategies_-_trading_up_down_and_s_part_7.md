Chapter 1 The Covered-Write • What is one’s risk appetite? — Is covered-writing part of a long-term strategy against a portfolio? — Is covered-writing part of a short-term trading strategy? • What is the goal of one’s covered-write? — Income generation? — Downside protection? — Some of each? • What is the current state of implied volatility in the market? — High volatility? — Low volatility? — What are the potential rates of return? What Is One’s Current Market Forecast? As we have mentioned several times, the covered-write is a neutral to moderately bullish strategy, so, first and foremost, it is mandatory to have a neutral to moderately bullish outlook on the stock or portfolio one is considering as a candidate for a covered-write program. An extremely bullish strategy is inappropriate because the upside is limited, and a bearish approach is also inappropriate because the long stock portion of the position will lose money, which is only partially offset by the premium received when writing the call. A sharp or sustained move lower in a stock or portfolio is disastrous for covered-writes. Whatever methodology one chooses to use for forecasting market behavior—fundamental analysis, technical analysis, broker forecasts and research, or other methods—one should consider a covered-write strategy only if confident in a market forecast of neutral to moderately bullish. Where the forecast falls within that range will help determine strike selection. It is always desirable to have the stock price greater than or equal to the strike price at expiration, to achieve maximum returns, so the strike selected for writing should be where one expects the stock to be at expiration. • Neutral to Bullish With a neutral outlook one is likely forecasting little change in the underlying price through expiration. In this case, one would want to write a call that is at-the-money to potentially achieve maximum returns. • Mildly Bullish With a mildly bullish outlook, one is most likely forecasting a slight rise in the underlying price through expiration. In this case, one would want to write a call that is out-of-the-money in the expected target zone to potentially achieve maximum returns. Strategy Component Selection • Moderately Bullish With a moderately bullish outlook, one is likely forecasting a more substantial rise in the underlying price through expiration. In this case, one would want to write a call that is further out-of-the-money in the expected target zone to attempt to achieve maximum returns. What Is One’s Risk Appetite? The risk appetite of an investor interested in pursuing a covered-write strategy is usually determined by the category into which he falls in terms of time frame. Risk appetite determines strike selection and duration. The risk in a covered-write is determined by the premium received for the written call, which provides some downside protection for the stock position. This premium, in turn, is determined by the location of the strike price relative to the stock price (moneyness) and the time until expiration (duration). • Long-Term (High Risk Appetite) The long-term covered writer usually has a portfolio of stocks that he or she has selected to hold. These investors have purchased the stocks in their portfolios because they like their long-term prospects and because they intend to hold them no matter what the market chooses to do in the short-term. They are pursuing a covered-write strategy against the stocks in their portfolio in order to help generate income and lower the overall cost basis of the portfolio. They are not particularly interested in the downside protection aspect of the covered-write since they are going to hold their portfolio regardless of what the market might do; therefore, they are less sensitive to risk. High Risk Appetite: Investors with high risk appetites can afford to collect less premium for downside protection; this allows them to write calls that are further out-of-the-money or of shorter duration. Writing calls that are further out-of-the-money creates a covered-write that has a stronger bullish stance, allowing for more potential appreciation in the stock price. Writing calls of shorter duration generates a larger time decay (theta) for faster income generation. • Short-Term (Low Risk Appetite) The short-term covered writer usually enters the position as a trade. In other words, he has no particular long-term view for the stock that he is buying; he is more interested in the potential return of the covered-write itself, and is attracted to situations where high volatility (higher call premiums) are throwing off high potential rates of return. Because, for these investors, the covered-write is a short-term strategy or trade, they are very sensitive to risk because a loss in the position cannot be recouped over time as it might be with a long-term covered-write. Indeed, because short-term covered writers tend to be more the “trader” type than the “investor” type, 17 18
