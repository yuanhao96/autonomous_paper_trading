This page intentionally left blank eight RISK AND MONEY MANAGEMENT Ruin is the risk you should be concerned with the most. It can come like a thief in the night and steal everything if you aren’t watching carefully. ike many of the concepts we use in trading, expectation, edge, risk of ruin and so on, the term money management comes from gambling theory. Money management is the art of keeping your risk of ruin at an acceptable level while maximizing your proﬁt potential by choosing an appropriate number of shares or contracts to trade, something we refer to as the size of the trade, and by limiting the aggregate size of the position to control exposure to price shocks. Good money management helps ensure that you will continue to be able to trade through the inevitable bad periods that every trader experiences. Most discussions of the topic make use of countless formulas and cover different methods for determining precisely the number of contracts one should trade. They approach risk as if it were a deﬁnable and knowable concept, but it isn’t. This chapter won’t duplicate those discussions. If you L • 109 • Copyright © 2007 by Curtis M. Faith.

I believe that money management is more art than science, or perhaps more like religion than art. There are no right answers. There are no best ways to deﬁne one’s risk position. There are only individual answers that work for each person; those answers can be obtained only by asking the right questions. At its core, money management is about ﬁnding the trade-off between taking so much risk that you end up losing everything or are forced to quit trading and, conversely, taking so little risk that you end up leaving too much money on the table. There are two primary ways that excessive risk can force you to stop trading: extended drawdowns that exceed your psychological limits and a sudden price shock that wipes out the account. Your proper level of risk is very much a function of what is important to you. For that reason, if you want to trade, you have to become intimately familiar with the implications of taking too much risk or too little risk so that you can make an informed decision. Many vendors of systems or courses on trading make it seem that anyone can follow their methods and achieve riches quickly and easily. They do this because it helps them sell more systems and more courses on trading. They understate the dangers of risk and overstate the probabilities and ease of attaining those riches. They are lying. The risk is real, and trading is not easy. It is very important to keep one thing in mind before deciding to be aggressive: Steady returns of 20 or 30 percent per year will make you a lot of money in a reasonably short period starting with almost any amount of money. The power of compounding is very Risk and Money Management • 111 strong, but only if you don’t lose everything and have to start over again. If you begin with $50,000, you will have almost $10 million after 20 years—if you can earn 30 percent returns. Trying to go for very aggressive returns of 100 percent or 200 percent per year greatly increases the chances that you will blow up and have to stop trading. I highly recommend taking a conservative approach for the ﬁrst several years of trading. Consider what would have happened if you had been trading with the Donchian Trend system in 1987 at aggressive levels. Figure 8-1 shows the drawdowns that are encountered as the risk levels increase. Note how the graph rises steadily and levels off at the 100 percent point. This means that if you were trading aggressively and risking 3 percent of your trading capital on each trade, you would have gone bust overnight because this drawdown is due entirely to that single day when the interest-rate markets reversed precipitously. For most people, a prudent way to trade would be at a level that demonstrates a drawdown, using historical simulations, that is at most one-half the level you believe you can tolerate. This will provide a buffer in case the system has a drawdown that is larger than what previously had been seen during testing. It also will make it less likely that an unexpected price shock will cause you to lose all your trading capital. Don’t Believe Everything You Hear Many people have touted money management as a magical elixir that can cure all that ails your trading.

Proper money management is quite simple. For a trading account of a particular size, you can safely buy a certain number of contracts in each futures market. For some markets and for smaller accounts this amount may be zero. For example, the natural gas (NYMEX symbol NG) contract earlier this year had an ATR that represented more than $7,500 per contract. Remember, this means that the value of the contract ﬂuctuated $7,500 on the average each day. Thus, for a system that used a 2-ATR stop such as the Donchian Trend system, a single trade could mean a loss of $15,000. If you were trading an acc
