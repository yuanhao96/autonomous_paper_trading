a certain way. With a cer­ tain rule set, Ule graphical indicator tells a trader key information on what has been happening with price over a certain time period. Examples of some indicators are Moving Averages, Average True Range (ATR), Stochas­ tic, Pivot points, and so forth. Hundreds of different strategies can be found with iJlese indicators. Strategies take the various indicators and come up with a certain set of rules that the trader can follow to trade. Infinite numbers of possihle strate­ gies call be created for a trading system by a trader with the hundreds of indicators available. Furthermore, some strategies focus only on certain markets and on certain time frames. The days of trading based on a sim­ ple strategy are gone! Technical charts are now cluttered with indicators, lines, text, graphical objects, and so forth. The charts are so cluttered that it is hard for anyone new to understand a chart at "flrst glance." It takes days and even months for someone to understand how to trade based on someone's trading system. My background is engineering and as a result, I tend to overcompli­ cate Ulings as many engineers have a tendency to do. Before the days of Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, I mainly traded stocks. If someone looked at m y charts before I adopted Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, he or she would be com­ pletely confused. In perfomling a technical analysis, I would first start by drawing Fibonacci lines and Gann lines.lf this revealed a possible entry, I would then look at the Commodity Channel Indicator (CCI), the Average from those indicators then I would look at the ma.rket 'indexes and see if it T111e Range indicator, and the stochastic indicator. If I got a "green light" supported my decision in the direction I planned to take. r never wanted to trade against the market in general and as a result, I would look at the Trading Index lndicator (TRIN) and then analyze the S&P futures with FibonaccilGanniCCIIATR, and so forth. If everything "lined up" on my two-monitor screen, then] moved forward to trade based on piv­ ots. I hope that everyone followed that because I was insane back in those days. I look back and wonder how] understood the complicated process that I created. That is a lot of work just to analyze one stock. You can im­ age how hard it was to analyze all5,OOO-plus stock instruments. One person stated it perfectly to me when they saw my screens: "death by indicators." Unlike technical analysis, which is graphical, the second analytical model-fundamental analysis-is based on numbers. Let us first look at fundamental analysis for stocks and how i t is used. In fundamental valu­ ation for stocks, you are looking to buy a stock based on Ulat company's being undervalued. In order to detelllline if a company is being wlderval­ ued, a "fair value" for a company needs to be determined. Some traders may use a ProfitlEamings (PIE) ratio to detemline whether to purchase a Introduction xiii stock. For example, if a PIE ratio of to is used, then
