Part V: The Part of Tens Here I offer a series of lists of key characteristics of successful traders, trading pitfalls to avoid, risk management rules to live by, and resources to continue your trading education. Icons Used in This Book Throughout this book, you see icons in the margins, highlighting certain paragraphs. Here are the icons I use and what they mean: Theories are fine, but anything marked with a Tip icon tells you what currency traders really think and respond to. These are the tricks of the trade. Paragraphs marked with the Remember icon contain the key takeaways from this book and the essence of each subject’s coverage. Achtung, baby! The Warning icon highlights potential errors and misconceptions that can cost you money, your sanity, or both. You can skip anything marked by the Technical Stuff icon without missing out on the main message, but you may find the information useful for a deeper understanding of the subject. Where to Go from Here This book is set up so you can jump right in to the topics that are of greatest interest to you. If you’re an absolute newcomer to trading in general and currencies in particular, I recommend reading Parts I and II to build a foundation for the other topics. If you have more experience with trading, use the table of contents and index to find the subject you have questions about right now. This book is a reference — keep it by your computer, and turn to it whenever you have a question about currency trading.
