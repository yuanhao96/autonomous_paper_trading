Section 24). A computer allows you to speed up your research and follow up on more leads. It is not a substitute for making trading decisions. A computer helps you analyze more markets in greater depth, but the ultimate responsibility for every trade rests with you. There are three types of trading software: toolboxes, black boxes, and gray boxes. A toolbox allows you to display data, draw charts, plot indicators, and even test your trading system. Toolboxes for options traders include option valuation models. It is as easy to adapt a good toolbox to your needs as it is to adjust your car seat. What goes inside a black box is secret. You feed it data, and it tells you when to buy and sell. It is like magic-a way to make money without thinking. Black boxes usually come with excellent historical track records. This is only natural because they were created to fit old data! Markets keep changing, and black boxes keep blowing up, but new generations of losers keep buying new black boxes. Gray boxes straddle the fence between toolboxes and black boxes. These packages are usually put out by prominent market personalities. They disclose the general logic of their system and allow you to adjust some of their parameters. Advisors Advisory newsletters are colorful splashes on the trading scene. Freedom of the press allows anyone to put a typewriter on his kitchen table, buy a few stamps, and start sending out a financial advisory letter. Their "track records" are largely an exercise in futility because hardly anybody ever takes every bit of advice in any newsletter. Some newsletters provide useful ideas and point readers in the direction of trading opportunities. A few offer educational value. Mostly, they sell outsiders an illusion of being an insider, of knowing what happens or is about to happen in the markets. Newsletters are good entertainment. Your subscription rents you a penpal who sends amusing and interesting letters and never asks you to write back, except for a check at renewal time. Services that rate newsletters are for-profit affairs run by small businessmen whose well-being depends on the well-being of the advisory industry. 14. THE TRADING SCENE 55 Rating services may occasionally tut-tut an advisor, but they dedicate most of their energy to loud cheerleading. I used to write an advisory newsletter: worked hard, did not fudge results, and received good ratings. I saw from the inside a tremendous potential for fudging results. This is a well-kept secret of the advisory industry. When I was getting into letter writing, one of the most prominent advisors told me that I should spend less time on research and more on marketing. The first principle of letter writing is: "If you have to make forecasts, make a lot of them." Whenever a forecast turns out right, double the volume of promotional mail. Trading Contests Trading contests are run by small firms or individuals. Contestants pay organizers to monitor their results and publicize the names of winners. Trading contests have two flaws -one mild, and another possibly criminal. This is a scandal waiting to be explored by investigative journalists. All contests hide information about losers and tell you only about winners. Each dog has its day in the sun, and most losers have at least one good quarter. If you keep entering contests and taking wild chances, eventually you will have a winning quarter, reap the publicity, and attract money management clients. Many advisors enter trading contests with a small stake, which they chalk off to marketing expense. If they get lucky they receive valuable publicity, while their losses are hidden. Nobody hears about a contestant who destroys his account. I know several traders who are so bad they could not trade candy with a child. They are chronic losers but all of them appeared on the list of winners of a major contest, with great percentage gains. That publicity allowed them to raise money from the public-which they proceeded to lose. If trading contests disclosed the names and results of all participants, that would promptly kill the enterprise. A more malignant flaw of trading contests is the financial collusion between some organizers and contestants. Many organizers have a direct financial incentive to rig the results and help their co-conspirators obtain publicity as winners. They use it to raise money from the public. The proprietor of one of the contests told me that he was raising money for his star winner. How objective can a judge be if he has a business relationship with one of his contestants? It appeared that the amount he could - 56 MASS PSYCHOLOGY raise depended on how well his "star" performed in his contest. That highly touted star promptly lost money put under his management. The worst abuses can occur in contests run by brokerage firms. A firm can set up contest rules, attract participants, have them trade through the firm, judge them, publicize their results, and then go for the jugular- raising money from the public for winners to manage, thereby generating fees and commissions. It would be easy for such a firm to create a star. All it would have to do is open several accounts for the designated "winner." At the end of each day it could put the best trades into a contest account and the rest of the trades into other accounts, creating a great "track record." Trading contests can be an attractive tool for fleecing the public. 15. THE MARKET CROWD AND YOU The market is a loosely organized crowd whose members bet that prices will rise or fall. Since each price represents the consensus of the crowd at the moment of transaction, all traders are in effect betting on the future mood of the crowd. That crowd keeps swinging from indifference to optimism or pessimism and from hope to fear. Most people do not follow their own trading plans because they let the crowd influence their feelings, thoughts, and actions. Bulls and bears battle in the market, and the value of your investment sink
