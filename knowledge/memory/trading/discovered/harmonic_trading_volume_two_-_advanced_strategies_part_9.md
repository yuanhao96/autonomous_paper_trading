Chapter 1 Contemporary Market Case Studies from a Harmonic Trading Perspective 15 throughout those early years. In the time since, the advancement of the Harmonic Trading methodology, in particular the new strategies outlined in this book, has improved the overall effectiveness and serves to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the basic pattern recognition approach. Frankly, I was challenged by the market environment during those first few months of reports. Beginning with the extreme multiyear rally of the 1990s and followed by a near-liquidation of the entire market, the remarkable volatility created one of the most difficult market environments of the past 100 years. From a harmonic pattern perspective, the bull market of the late ’90s possessed many bearish patterns that were continually violated. The strong price action overwhelmed many of these setups. Conversely, the bear market from 2000-2003 annihilated what seemed to be once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunities. I learned a great deal during this time. In the long run, this was an important evolutionary process for the entire Harmonic Trading methodology. The lessons learned during this time made me focus on price action in the completion area of harmonic patterns more than the patterns themselves, which led to a more accurate and unbiased analysis of the overall direction of the markets. This opened my eyes and spawned a more flexible interpretation of harmonic price action. In addition, the change in thinking led to a greater integration of applying these patterns within the constraints of the overall trend, especially when related to other standard technical measures. Although this advancement required many years to develop, the time and research invested has yielded significantly improved the strategies and substantially enhanced the already potent capabilities of the Harmonic Trading approach. Market Positions As a part of my advisory service for HarmonicTrader.com, I wrote market reports for the three primary U.S. indices—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the NASDAQ Composite. The following synopsis of these reports represents an accurate research study on the effectiveness of these techniques in real-time situations. Throughout this time period, my reasons for particular market positions and specific price targets were clearly stated and presented well in advance. From a general perspective, my advisory service official positions for each of the three major U.S. indices were as follows: • 1998–September 2000: Bullish • September 2000–April 2003: Bearish • April 2003–November 2003: Neutral • November 2003: Bullish I will explain the various pattern developments of the times and my reasons for the analysis presented. The recommendations of the advisory service were exclusively based on Harmonic Trading measurement techniques. It is important to be mindful of the progression of pattern analysis and the associated price action, as various harmonic scenarios unfolded. The most important point is that distinct harmonic measurement techniques provided consistently reliable technical information throughout this entire time period. The end result was an extremely 16 Harmonic Trading: Volume Two accurate collection of monthly reports that defined critical technical price levels and the major changes in the overall market direction during a rather volatile long-term market environment. Standard & Poor’s 500 Review Of the three major U.S. indices, the Standard & Poor’s 500 was a leading index that frequently formed distinct harmonic patterns and responded well to critical long-term Fibonacci levels of support and resistance. In fact, the S&P 500 was my baseline index for the entire market. In essence, the price action on the S&P 500 and the validity of the various harmonic setups effectively indicated the probable future price action for the markets in general. For example, it was common for the markets to form different harmonic patterns within each index simultaneously. The S&P 500 was typically forming the most distinct patterns with price action that provided clues of the impending direction before the other two indices. Therefore, a failure in a pattern in the S&P 500 would typically translate into a failure of another pattern in one of the other two indices. Bearish Gartley Marks the Beginning of the Bear In my S&P 500 analysis, I identified some significant harmonic developments that pointed to a major reversal at hand. After the bull market of the 1990s ended with the decade, the index quickly violated some critical technical levels that suggested a greater correction was in the works. In fact, the index formed a Bearish Gartley on the weekly chart in August 2000 that marked a significant failure of the prior all-time high. This pattern turned out to be the structure that initiated the multiyear bear market. The reversal from the Bearish Gartley was the first significant failure of a prior high within the established bullish trend in nearly five years. The price action from 1995–2000 was among the strongest bull markets in history. Although I maintained a bullish position from 1998 until September 2000, this pattern was clearly signaling trouble for the S&P 500 on a long-term basis. The reversal from its completion was one of the primary reasons for my bearish position. Standard & Poor’s 500 (^SPX): Weekly Bearish Gartley It all started with this weekly Bearish Gartley just above the 1500 area (see Figure 1.1). Although the CD leg was a bit extended, the structure possessed a precise alignment of harmonic ratios to validate the pattern. The interesting aspect of the price action was the decisive downside continuation following the completion of the pattern. I outlined this setup as early as June 2000, stating in the monthly report:
