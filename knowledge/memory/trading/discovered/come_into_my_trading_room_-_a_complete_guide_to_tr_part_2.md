Part 2 and look at the best ones for getting started. WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE? Winning in the Futures Markets by George Angell is the best introductory book for futures traders. (It is highly superior to all his other books.) The Futures Game by Teweles and Jones is a mini-encyclopedia that has educated generations of futures traders (be sure to get the latest edition). Economics of Futures Trading by Thomas A. Hieronymus is probably the most profound book on futures, but it’s long been out of print—try finding a used copy. OPTIONS An option is a bet that a specific stock, index, or future will reach or exceed a specific price within a specific time. Please stop and reread that sentence. Notice that the word specific occurs in it three times. You must choose the right stock, predict the extent of its move, and forecast how fast it’ll get there. You must make three choices—if you’re wrong on just one, you’ll lose money. When you buy an option, you have to jump through three hoops in a single leap. You have to be right on the stock or the future, right on its move, and right on its timing. Ever tried tossing a ball through three rings at an amusement park? This triple complexity makes buying options a deadly game. Options offer leverage—an ability to control large positions with a small outlay of cash. The entire risk of an option is limited to the price WHAT MARKETS TO TRADE? 21 you pay for it. Options allow traders to make money fast when they’re right, but if the market reverses, you can walk away and owe nothing! This is the standard flow of brokerage house propaganda. It attracts hordes of small traders who cannot afford to buy stocks but want a bigger bang for their buck. What usually gets banged is the option buyer’s head. My company, Financial Trading, Inc., has been selling books to traders for years. Whenever a person comes back to buy another book, it is a sign that he is active in the markets. Many clients buy books on stocks or futures every few months or years. But when a first-time buyer orders a book on options, he never returns. Why? Does he make so much money so fast that he doesn’t need another book? Or does he wash out? Many beginners buy calls because they can’t afford stocks. Futures traders who get beat up sometimes turn to options on futures. Losers switch to options instead of dealing with their own inability to trade. Using a shortcut to weasel out of trouble instead of facing a problem never works. Successful stock and futures traders sometimes use options to reduce risks or protect profits. Serious traders buy options rarely and only in special situations, as we will see later in this book. Options are hopeless for poor people who use them as substitutes for stocks because they can’t afford the real thing. Professionals take full advantage of starry-eyed beginners crowding into options. Their bid-ask spreads are terrible. If an option is bid 75 cents, offered at a dollar, you are 25% behind the game as soon as you buy. The expression “your loss is limited to what you paid for an option” means you can lose 100%! What’s so great about losing everything? A client of mine was a market-maker on the floor of the American Stock Exchange. She came to my classes on technical analysis because she was pregnant and wanted to get off the floor and trade from home. “Options,” she said, “are a hope business. You can buy hope or sell hope. I am a professional—I sell hope. I come to the floor in the morning and find what the public wants. Then I price that hope and sell it to them.” Professionals are more likely to write options than buy them. Writing is a capital-intensive business. You need hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it right, and most successful options writers operate with millions. And even theirs is not a risk-free game. Several years ago a friend who used to be one of the nation’s top money managers landed 22 FINANCIAL TRADING FOR BABES IN THE WOODS on the front page of The Wall Street Journal after he lost 20 years’ worth of profits in a single bad day of writing naked puts. There are two types of option writers. Covered writers buy a stock and write an option against it. Naked writers write calls and puts on stocks they don’t own, backing their writes with cash in their accounts. Writing naked options feels like taking money out of thin air, but a violent move can put you out of business. Writing options is a serious game, suitable only for disciplined and well-capitalized traders. Markets are like pumps that suck money out of the pockets of the poorly informed majority and pump it into the pockets of a savvy minority. People who service those pumps, such as brokers, vendors, regulators, and even janitors who sweep exchange floors, are paid from the stream of money flowing through the markets. Since markets take money from the majority, pay help, and give what’s left to the savvy minority, the majority, by definition, must lose. You can be sure that whatever the majority of traders does, believes, and says, is not worth doing, believing, and saying. You have to stand apart from the crowd in order to succeed. Smart traders look for situations where a large majority does something one way, while a small, moneyed minority goes the opposite way. In options the majority buys calls and, to a lesser degree, puts. The insiders almost exclusively write options. Professionals use their heads, while amateurs are driven by greed and fear. Options take full advantage of those feelings. Greed is the engine of option-selling propaganda. You must have heard the slogan: “Control a large block of stock with just a few dollars!” An amateur may be bullish on a $60 stock, but doesn’t have $6,000 to buy 100 shares. He buys some $70 calls with two months of life left in them for $500 each. If that stock rises to 75, those options will acquire $500 of intrinsic value, while maintaining some time value, and a speculator can double his stake in a month! The amateur buys calls and sit
