Chapter 1 (Fundamental Analysis: The Strengths and Weaknesses of Traditional Exchange Rate Models) which as the title suggests examines the contribution of macroeconomics to the ﬁeld of currency analysis. As we have already seen brieﬂy in this Introduction, economics has created a number of equilibrium-based valuation models. Generally speaking, such models try to determine an equilibrium exchange rate based on the relative pricing of goods, money and trade. In turn, this concept of relative pricing can be broken down into four main types of long-term valuation model, which focus on international competitiveness, key monetary themes, interest rate differentials and the balance of payments. I would suggest that while such equilibrium exchange rate models are an indispensable tool for analysing long-term exchange rate trends, their predictive track record for short-term moves is mixed at best. Moreover, as we noted above, they are based on the concept of an equilibrium, which rarely exists in reality and if it does exist is in any case a moving target. This is in no way to attempt to downplay the immense contribution that economics has made to currency analysis, rather it is to emphasize the different focus of the two disciplines. Whereas economics seeks to determine the “big picture”, currency analysis seeks speciﬁc exchange rate forecasts 10 Currency Strategy over speciﬁc time frames. Neither is “better” or “worse”. They are merely different analytical disciplines responding to a different set of requirements. In the very act of attempting practical modiﬁcations to the classical economic approach towards exchange rates, one pays homage to the original work. Precisely because currency markets are affected by so many different factors, it has proved an extremely difﬁcult (if not impossible) task for economists to design fundamental equilibrium models with predictive capacity for exchange rates for anything other than the long term. Thus,
