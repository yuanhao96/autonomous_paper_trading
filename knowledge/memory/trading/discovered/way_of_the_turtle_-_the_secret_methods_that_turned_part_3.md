Chapter 13 in our discussion of portfolio and market analysis. Avoid the Future Tense Earlier in the book we established how cognitive biases can torture potentially good traders. Recency bias, the strong need to feel that one is right, and the propensity to predict the future are to be avoided at all costs. • 51 • Table 4-1 1998 Cocoa Breakout Trades Number Unit Entry Position Price Quantity Exit % Proﬁt 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 27 Apr 6 May 12 May 14 May 23 Jun 25 Jun 29 Jun 15 Jul 27 Jul 3 Aug 13 Aug 17 Aug 24 Aug 16-Sep 1 Oct 13 Oct 28 Oct 6 Nov 20 Nov 24 Nov 30 Nov 8 Dec 21 Dec 4 Jan 15 Jan 25 Jan 27 Jan 8 Feb L LL LL LL S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S 2,249 2,261 2,276 2,283 2,100 2,094 2,085 2,070 2,069 2,050 2,036 2,024 2,024 2,014 1,979 1,976 1,967 1,961 1,918 1,903 1,892 1,873 1,824 1,808 1,798 1,748 1,742 1,738 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 5 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 7 2,234 2,246 2,261 2,268 2,114 2,108 2,099 2,084 2,083 2,064 2,049 2,036 2,035 2,026 1,992 1,988 1,979 1,438 1,928 1,914 1,903 1,438 1,836 1,820 1,438 1,760 1,754 1,438 (2.4) (2.1) (2.2) (2.4) (2.3) (2.4) (3.0) (2.5) (1.9) (2.7) (2.2) (3.0) (2.4) (2.1) (2.4) (2.2) (2.1) 75.0 (2.4) (3.0) (2.7) 67.2 (3.5) (2.4) 46.7 (2.1) (2.1) 42.8 $ (1,197) $ (1,026) $ (1,036) $ (1,133) $ (1,061) $ (1,053) $ (1,317) $ (1,066) $ (777) $ (1,104) $ (848) $ (1,155) $ (874) $ (756) $ (845) $ (779) $ (722) $ 24,940 $ (799) $ (975) $ (834) $ 20,575 $ (1,075) $ (709) $ 13,468 $ (608) $ (605) $ 19,275 Total $(16,750) $55,903 52 • Way of the Turtle To overcome the third afﬂiction, you need to think about the future in terms of possibilities and probabilities rather than in terms of prediction. When my circle of friends learned of my success as a Turtle, they kept asking what direction I thought a particular market would take. Everyone assumed that because I was part of a renowned trading group and had made millions trading futures, it must have been because I knew something deﬁnitive about the future. My standard response surely surprised them: “I have no idea.” The truth was that I really didn’t. Sure, I could have guessed, but I had absolutely no faith in my ability to predict markets. In fact, I purposely did not attempt to predict the future direction of markets. Unfortunately, unless you happen to be an actuary working for an insurance company, you generally do not think in terms of probabilities. People tend to think in terms of likely or unlikely but never in terms of probabilities. That is why insurance companies insure against uncertain risks. An event such as a hurricane destroying your house is one such risk. There is a certain probability that there will be a hurricane that affects your house if you live near the tropical ocean. There is a slightly lower probability that the hurricane will be strong enough to damage your home. There is an even lower probability that it will be powerful enough to destroy your home completely. If you knew that your house would be destroyed by a hurricane with 100 percent certainty, you would not buy insurance; you would move. Fortunately, the risk of that happening is less than 100 percent, so much less in fact that you decide to stay and insure your house. An insurance company that insures against hurricanes will have a fairly good idea of the level of damage that is likely to occur at your particular location when it prices a policy covering such an Think Like a Turtle • 53 event. This is how insurance companies make money: They sell policies to cover risks for less than the probable cost of payout under those policies. Trading is much the same as insuring against uncertain risks. Trading is ﬁlled with uncertainties. You do not know whether a trade is going to make money. The best you can do is be conﬁdent that the rewards will outweigh the risks over the long run. Thinking in Probabilities Many of you took probability and statistics courses in high school or college. No doubt you would have seen a graph like the one shown in Figure 4-1. Figure 4-1 shows what is known as a normal distribution. This particular graph depicts the distribution of women’s height. The Normal (Gaussian) Distribution 0.18 90% Probability Density 0.14 80% 0.12 70% 0.1 60% 0.08 50% 40% 0.06 30% 0.04 20% 0.02 10% 0 0 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 Figure 4-1 A Normal Distribution of Women’s Height Copyright 2006 Trading Blox, LLC. All rights reserved worldwide. Cumulative Probability 100% 0.16 54 • Way of the Turtle bottom axis shows the height in inches, and the side axis indicates the two aspects of probability: 1. Probability density graph: The shaded area uses the legend on the left and shows how likely a particular height may be. In this case, the average height is 5 feet 4 inches. The probability of a woman’s height being closer to that average is greater than its probability of being farther away. The higher spots in the middle of the graph indicate the most likely possibilities, and the lower height areas toward the sides indicate less likely possibilities. For example, the height of the curve at 70 inches is much lower than it is at 68 inches, indicating the lower probability that a woman will attain a height of 5 foot 10 inches compared with a height of 5 foot 8 inches. 2. Cumulative probability curve: The solid line runs from 0 percent to 100 percent and uses the legend on the right. It shows the cumulative probability of a woman attaining at least a particular height. For example, if you look at the green line, you can see that it reaches almost 100 percent at about the 70-inch level. The actual value at 70 inches is 99.18 percent, meaning that less than 1 percent of women are 5 foot 10 inches or taller. This graph and others like it use complex mathematical formulas, but they all represent a simple concept: There is a decreasing likelihood of a woman attaining
