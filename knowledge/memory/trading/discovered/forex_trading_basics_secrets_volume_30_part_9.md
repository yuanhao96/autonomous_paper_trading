Section 01 | Introduction and key concepts How much should I invest? Traders should look to use an effective leverage of 10-to1 or less. Research shows that the amount of capital in your trading account can affect your profitability. Traders with at least $5,000 of capital tend to utilize more conservative amounts of leverage. It is recommended to invest $1,000 - $5,000 and use a leverage of 1:10. With smaller investment you will not get enough profits as the average changes in the currency rates are small. Thus traders who invest small amounts ($50 - $100) are inclined to use big leverages to get tangible profits, which in turn is very risky.
