Though smoking was strictly prohibited in offices owned by the US. government, an ashtray was full and a thick fog hung close to the ceiling. With absolutely no introduction, the warden said, "Sit over there, Mr. Backman." "A pleasure to meet you," Backman said as he looked at the other men in the room. "Why, exactly, am I here?" "We'll discuss that." ''Could you please remove these handcuffs? I promise not to kill anyone." The warden snapped at the nearest guard, who quickly found a key and freed Backman. The guard then scrambled out of the room, slamming the door behind him, much to the displeasure of the warden, a very nervous man. He pointed and said, "This is Special Agent Adair of the FBI. This is Mr. Knabe from the Justice Department. And this is Mr. Size- more, also from Washington." None of the three moved in the direction of Mr. Backman, who was still standing and looking quite perplexed. He nodded at them, in a halfhearted effort to be polite. His efforts were not returned. "Please sit," the warden said, and Backman finally took a chair. "Thank you. As you know, Mr. Backman, a new president is about to be sworn in. President Morgan is on the way out.

In return for a full pardon, you must agree to leave the country, never return, and live with a new identity in a place where no one can find you." No problem there, thought Backman. He didn't want to be found. "But why?" he mumbled again. The bottle of water in his left hand could actually be seen shaking. As Mr. Sizemore from Washington watched it shake, he studied Joel Backman, from his closely cropped gray hair to his battered dime- store running shoes, with his black prison-issue socks, and couldn't help but recall the image of the man in his prior life. A magazine cover came to mind. A fancy photo of Joel Backman in a black Italian suit, impeccably tailored and detailed and groomed and looking at the camera with as much smugness as humanly possible. The hair was longer and darker, the handsome face was fleshy and wrinkle free, the waistline was thick and spoke of many power lunches and four-hour dinners. He loved wine and women and sports cars. He had a jet,
