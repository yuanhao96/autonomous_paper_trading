monumental concepts and ideas which emerged in this book Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits: A Course in Forecasting came, and have proven to be the foundation of modern Technical Analysis. It is certainly this writer’s opinion that this Course by Schabacker represents the finest work ever produced on conventional Technical Analysis. The qualifying word “conventional” is inserted because it must be used in comparison to the work of William D. Gann who was equally as great, but more in terms of the “unconventional” technical approach with which he is associated. It seems almost unbelievable that such remarkable writings could have remained unknown to the investment public for so long. Other than Edwards in his introduction to Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, we know of no other reference to it. Market students should be aware of how this happened, as it is a too familiar story that equally applies to a great number of other superb technical works that also remain almost unknown today; an unwelcome fate that leaves the Technical Analysis fraternity much the poorer. However, before going into the historical reasons and developments that resulted in the dearth of classical Technical Analysis writings that has haunted the field for many years, it would be well to take a closer look at this classical work by Schabacker which remains an example of the highest order of analytical quality and incisive technical thought, and should serve as an ideal to technical students everywhere.

Certainly these are not very exciting subjects, and for us today, even less exciting, as the computer has changed many of the mechanical aspects of buying and selling that the brokerage offices and exchanges used to rely on to accomplish their tasks. It is the remaining third of the book that was destined to greatly heighten our interest. For it is here that the author for the first time in memory presented Technical Analysis as a totally organized subject wherein he comprehensively laid out the various important patterns, formations, trends, support and resistance areas, and associated supporting technical detail. Just two years later, in 1932, came the publication of the first edition of
