Chapter 4. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this information to assess current and future performance. This requires a great deal of work and thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental analysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast of news and announcements that can indicate potential changes to the economic, social, and political environment. All traders should have some awareness of the broad economic conditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who are trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is already completely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EUR/USD, say, could be nominal. Taking a step back, currency prices move primarily based on supply and demand. That is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand for that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative, or conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency. Currency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be the real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to 29 predict supply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors that contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency, such as capital flows, trade flows, speculative needs, and hedging needs. For example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) from 1999 to the end of 2001, a situation primarily driven by the U.S. Internet and equity market boom and the desire for foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand for U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase U.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, when geopolitical uncertainty rose, the United States started cutting interest rates and foreign investors began to sell U.S. assets in search of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars, increasing supply and lowering the dollars value against other major currencies. The availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can impact the direction that a currency trades. It has been a primary determinant for the U.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005. Foreign official purchases of U.S. assets (also known as the Treasury international capital flow or TIC data) have become one of the most important economic indicators anticipated by the markets. Capital and Trade Flows Capital flows and trade flows constitute a country's balance of payments, which quantifies the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time. Theoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to maintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is entering, and hence theoretically the currency should fall in value. This is particularly important in current conditions (at the lime of this book's publication) where the United States is running a consistently large trade deficit without sufficient foreign inflow to fund that deficit. As a result of this very problem, the trade-weighted dollar index fell 22 percent in value between 2003 and 2005. The Japanese yen is another good example. As one of the world's largest exporters, Japan runs a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that prevents capital flows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade higher based on trade flows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more specific, here is a detailed explanation of what capital and trade flows encompass. Capital Flows: Measuring Currency Bought and Sold Capital flows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold due to capital investments. A positive capital flow balance implies that foreign inflows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outflows. A negative capital flow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments bought by domestic investors than foreign investors. Let's look at these two types of capital flows—physical flows and portfolio flows. Physical Flows. Physical flows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as investments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require that a foreign corporation sell the local currency and buy the 30 foreign currency, which leads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock. Physical flows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes in actual physical investment activity. These flows shift in response to changes in each country’s financial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that encourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical flows. For example, due to China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), its foreign investment laws have been relaxed. As a result of its cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population of over 1 billion), corporations globally have flooded China with investments. From an FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need to sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB). Portfolio Flows. Portfolio flows involve measuring capital inflows and outflows in equity markets and fixed income markets. Equity Markets. As technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital, investing in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a rallying stork market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all, regardless of geographic location. The result of this has become
