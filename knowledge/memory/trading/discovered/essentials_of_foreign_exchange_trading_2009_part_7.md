CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Foreign Exchange Trading After reading this chapter, you will be able to: ● Understand the basic facts and history of the global foreign exchange market. ● Appreciate the characteristics that set forex apart from other financial markets. ● Assess who the real market players are, and how they may affect currency prices. ● Decide whether foreign exchange trading is right for you. ● Know what to expect from this book. 1 c01.indd 1 1/13/09 9:51:56 AM I n t r o d u c t i o n t o F o r e i g n E x c h a n g e Tr a d i n g T rading Money to Make Money Foreign exchange trading is essentially about trading money. There are several reasons why people and institutions would want to trade money. The two primary reasons are currency conversion and speculation. Currency conversion is simply the changing of money from one currency to another for the primary purpose of purchasing goods, services, or assets from a foreign country. For an American company to buy British goods, for example, would necessitate the conversion of U.S. dollars to British pounds. This book will focus exclusively on foreign exchange trading for speculative purposes, or trading money with the explicit goal of making money. This speculation process is very similar to trading in stocks or futures. The goal, whether on a long-term or short-term basis, is to earn profits from price changes. Just as a stock like Microsoft will move up and down in price, currencies will also move up and down in price. The real trick is to be on the right side of the move, and to reap profits in return for assuming the risk of taking the trade. Of course, there are many important ways in which trading foreign exchange is completely different from trading stocks or futures, but the primary objective is the same. If a trader buys shares in Microsoft, for instance, the hope is that the value of the shares will go up and the trader will earn profits. In the same vein, if a trader buys the Japanese yen, the hope is that the value of the yen increases so that the trader will earn a profit on owning that currency. Learning how to make money by trading money is not an easy task. There are many factors that combine to make any given foreign exchange trader a successful one. This combination usually includes 2 c01.indd 2 1/13/09 9:51:58 AM Striking Gold plenty of often painful trading experience, good risk management skills, solid technical and fundamental analytical abilities, and a sound psychological make-up. All of these will be discussed in detail further along in the book. To begin with, though, an introduction to the world of foreign exchange trading is in order. This will cover all of the basics, and will begin with a very brief history lesson. S triking Gold Although money in one form or another has been around pretty much since the beginning of time, modern speculative foreign exchange trading (also known as “FX,” “forex,” or “currency trading”) is considered to have begun on a major scale relatively recently. In modern times, the world’s currencies truly began to float freely and be traded extensively in the early 1970s, after the collapse of the Bretton Woods Agreements. These agreements, established during the tail-end of World War II in July 1944, came about as a result of meetings between representatives of all the Allied nations in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, U.S.A. Among other accomplishments resulting from Bretton Woods, each of these nations agreed to adopt a monetary policy that would effectively fix the exchange rate of its currency in relation to the U.S. dollar, which in turn would be fixed to gold at a rate of USD $35.00 per ounce of gold. These changes were akin to reinstating characteristics of the Gold Standard, but this time via the U.S. dollar. 3 c01.indd 3 1/13/09 9:51:58 AM I n t r o d u c t i o n t o F o r e i g n E x c h a n g e Tr a d i n g Clearly, with the Bretton Woods Agreements in place, foreign exchange trading on any significant scale was virtually impossible and nonproductive due to the nonfloating nature of currency values. While the valiant purposes of Bretton Woods were to control conflict, maintain monetary stability, and discourage currency speculation, the agreements underwent increasing pressure as the U.S. suspended the dollar’s convertibility into gold in 1971. The Bretton Woods Agreements finally collapsed in the same year. By 1973, with the complete collapse of Bretton Woods and other similar agreements that strived to impose order on the global currency system, the world’s currencies truly began to float much more freely. This meant that the market forces of supply and demand would take precedence over international political consensus, and that mass speculation by banks and institutions would soon become rampant. Although most individual traders could not take part in the new market, this time period marked the birth of modern-day forex trading as we know it today. B uying and Selling at Retail Fast forward to around 1996, as computers and the Internet began making online financial trading both practical and in demand. With stock trading starting to go online, foreign exchange brokers/ market-makers began emerging to create and satisfy a new demand for retail forex trading. Prior to this time, access to speculative forex trading was reserved almost exclusively for banks and large institutions. With the advent of online platform trading, however, access for the average individual trader/investor opened up in a major way. 4 c01.indd 4 1/13/09 9:51:58 AM Big and Liquid, Like the Ocean This new frontier of retail currency trading was in the arena of “spot forex,” which was clearly differentiated from futures and forwards. Spot foreign exchange trading is distinguished by its almost immediate delivery of the currency, rather than future delivery. Of course, in speculative currency trading, the actual physical currency never gets delivered—delivery is simply “rolled over” continuously to
