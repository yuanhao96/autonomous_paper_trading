Chapter 10, "Risk Management"). Give yourself several years to learn how to trade. Do not start with an account bigger than $20,000, and do not lose more than 2 percent of your equity on any single trade. Learn from cheap mistakes in a small account. Amateurs neither expect to lose nor are in any way prepared for it. The notion of being undercapitalized is a cop-out that helps them avoid two painful truths: their lack of trading discipline, and their lack of a realistic money management plan. The one advantage of a large trading account is that the price of equipment and services represents a smaller percentage of your money. A manager of a million-dollar fund who spends $10,000 on computers and seminars is only 1 percent behind the game. The same expenditure would represent 50 percent of the equity of a trader with a $20,000 account. The Autopilot Myth Imagine that a stranger walks into your driveway and tries to sell you an automatic system for driving your car. Just pay a few hundred dollars for a computer chip, install it in your car, and stop wasting energy on driving, he says. You can take a nap in the driver's seat while the "Easy Swing System" whisks you to work. You would probably laugh the salesman out of your driveway. But would you laugh if he tried to sell you an automatic trading system? Traders who believe in the autopilot myth think that the pursuit of wealth can be automated. Some try to develop an automatic trading system, while others buy one from the experts. Men who have spent years honing their skills as lawyers, doctors, or businessmen plunk down thousands of dollars for canned competence. They are driven by greed, laziness, and mathematical illiteracy. Systems used to be written on sheets of paper, but now they usually come on copy-protected diskettes. Some are primitive; others are elaborate, with built-in optimization and money management rules. Many traders spend thousands of dollars searching for magic that will turn a few pages of computer code into an endless stream of money. People who pay for automatic trading systems are like medieval knights who paid alchemists for the secret of turning base metals into gold. 16 INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY Complex human activities do not lend themselves to automation. Computerized learning systems have not replaced teachers, and programs for doing taxes have not created unemployment among accountants. Most human activities call for an exercise of judgment; machines and systems can help but not replace humans. So many system buyers have been burned that they have formed an organization, Club 3000, named after the price of many systems. If you could buy a successful automatic trading system, you could move to Tahiti and spend the rest of your life in leisure, supported by a stream of checks from your broker. So far, the only people who have made money from trading systems are the system sellers. They form a small but colorful cottage industry. If their systems worked, why would they sell them? They could move to Tahiti themselves and cash checks from their brokers! Meanwhile, every system seller has a line. Some say they like programming better than trading. Others claim that they sell their systems only to raise trading capital. Markets always change and defeat automatic trading systems. Yesterday's rigid rules work poorly today and will probably stop working tomorrow. A competent trader can adjust his methods when he detects trouble. An automatic system is less adaptable and self-destructs. Airlines pay high salaries to pilots despite having autopilots. They do it because humans can handle unforeseen events. When a roof blows off an airliner over the Pacific or when a plane runs out of gas over the Canadian wilderness, only a human can handle such a crisis. These emergencies have been reported in the press, and in each of them experienced pilots managed to land their airliners by improvising. No autopilot can do that. Betting your money on an automatic system is like betting your life on an autopilot. The first unexpected event will destroy your account. There are good trading systems out there, but they have to be monitored and adjusted using individual judgment. You have to stay on the ball-you cannot abdicate your responsibility for your success to a trading system. Traders who have the autopilot fantasy try to repeat what they felt as infants. Their mothers used to fulfill their needs for food, warmth, and comfort. Now they try to re-create the experience of passively lying on their backs and having profits flow to them like an endless stream of free, warm milk. The market is not your mother. It consists of tough men and women who look for ways to take money away from you instead of pouring milk into your mouth. 6 . MARKET GURUS 17 The Personality Cult Most people give lip service to their wish for freedom and independence. When they come under pressure, they change their tune and start looking for "strong leadership." Traders in distress often seek directions from assorted gurus. When I was growing up in the former Soviet Union, children were taught that Stalin was our great leader. Later we found out what a monster he had been, but while he was alive, most people enjoyed following the leader. He freed them from the need to think for themselves. "Little Stalins" were installed in every area of society-in economics, biology, architecture, and so on. When I came to the United States and began to trade, I was amazed to see how many traders were looking for a gurutheir "little Stalin" in the market. The fantasy that someone else can make you rich deserves its own discussion later in this chapter. Trade with Your Eyes Open Every winner needs to master three essential components of trading: a sound individual psychology, a logical trading system, and a good money management plan. These essentials are like three legs of a stool-remove one and the stool will fall, .together with the person who sits on it. Losers try to build a st
