Chapter 1 • Trend Following 5 your investment goals or retire. You’ve held on to your remaining investments believing that they will eventually turn around, but deciding how to invest your 401k monies is paralyzing. You still believe that buying and holding is the way to go. You’ve now begun to think that winning in the markets is just plain dumb luck. Or, maybe you view your money world like this: Sure, you lost some cash in the bear market and sure you lost more in October and November 2008, but, win or lose, you enjoy the thrill of investing in stock in the hopes of making a profit. Investing is entertainment for you. Plus, you like to boast about your investments for the admiration of others. You know you can be depressed and angry when you lose, but you also know that when you win you feel terrific. It’s a great high. Because your main goal is to invest for quick profits, you’re going to keep on doing what you’ve always done. After all, there was one time a few years ago when trading off a “hot tip” made you a nice profit. If you think education is expensive, try ignorance. Derek Bok There is a much better way to think about making money. How would you feel about embracing this perspective? Your approach is objective and rational. You have enough confidence in your own decision making that you don’t seek out investment recommendations from others. You’re content to wait patiently until the right opportunity comes along. Yet, you’re never too proud to buy a stock that is making new highs. For you, buying opportunities are usually market breakouts. Conversely, when you recognize that you are wrong, you exit immediately. You view a loss as an opportunity to learn, move on, and save your money for another day. What good is obsessing on the past going to do for you? You approach your trading as a business, making note of what you buy or sell and why in the same matter-of-fact way that you balance your checkbook. By not personalizing your trading decisions, you can make them without emotional indecision. That is a stark contrast in perspectives. The first is that of a generally a market loser; the latter is that of a potential market winner. Don’t be in such a hurry to choose the winning approach until you’ve found out just what making such a choice entails. On the other hand, I hope you’ll find in trend following trading the inspiration to step up to the plate and go for it without fear or reservation. And don’t be shy about it. You have to want to make money. You have to want to get ahead and be successful, the critics’ condemnation be damned. Speculation, as von Mises has noted, is The perfect speculator must know when to get in; more important, he must know when to stay out; and most important, he must know when to get out once he’s in. 6 Trend Following (Updated Edition): Learn to Make Millions in Up or Down Markets not only honorable, but a lifeblood. Profit-seeking speculation is the driving force of the market.5 Investor Versus Trader Do you consider yourself an investor or a trader? Most people think of themselves as investors. However, if you knew that the biggest winners in the markets call themselves traders, wouldn’t you want to know why? Simply put, they don’t invest; they trade. Nothing has changed during the 21 years we’ve been managing money. Government regulation and intervention have been, are, and will continue to be present for as long as society needs rules by which to live. Today’s governmental intervention or decree is tomorrow’s opportunity. For example, governments often act in the same way that cartels act. Easily the most dominant and effective cartel has been OPEC, and even OPEC has been unable to create an ideal world from the standpoint of pricing its product. Free markets will always find their own means of price discovery. Keith Campbell6 Investors put their money, or capital, into a market, such as stocks or real estate, under the assumption that the value will always increase over time. As the value increases, so does the person’s “investment.” Investors typically do not have a plan for when their investment value decreases. They usually hold on to their investment, hoping that the value will reverse itself and go back up. Investors typically succeed in bull markets and lose in bear markets. This is because investors anticipate bear (down) markets with fear and trepidation, and therefore, they are unable to plan how to respond when they start to lose. They choose to “hang tight,” and they continue to lose. They have an idea that a different approach to their losing involves more complicated trading techniques such as “selling short,” of which they know little and don’t care to learn. If the mainstream press continually positions investing as “good” or “safe” and trading as “bad” or “risky,” people are reluctant to align themselves with traders or even seek to understand what trading is about. A trader has a defined plan or strategy to put capital into a market to achieve a single goal: profit. Traders don’t care what they own or what they sell as long as they end up with more money than they started with. They are not investing in anything. They are trading. It is a critical distinction. Tom Basso, a longtime trader, has said that a person is a trader whether or not he is actually trading. Some people think they must be in and out of the markets every day to call themselves traders. What makes someone a trader has more to do with his perspective on life more so than making a given trade. For example, a great trader’s perspective includes extreme patience.
