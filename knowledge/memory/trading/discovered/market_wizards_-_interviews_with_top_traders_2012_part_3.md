Part V-The Psychology of Trading.................................................................................................195 Dr. Van K. Tharp-The Psychology of Trading ..................................................................................196 The Trade-A Personal Experience .................................................................................................206 Postscript-Dreams and Trading .....................................................................................................209 Final Word........................................................................................................................................211 Appendix 1-Program Trading and Portfolio Insurance...............................................................213 Appendix 2 - Options—Understanding the Basics* .....................................................................214 3 Preface There are some amazing stories here: A trader who, after wiping out several times early in his career, turned a $30,000 account into $80 million A fund manager who achieved what many thought impossible—five consecutive years of triple-digit percentage returns A trader from small-town America who started out on a shoestring and has become one of the world's largest bond traders A former securities analyst who, during the past seven years, has realized an average monthly return of 25 percent (over 1,400 percent armualized), primarily trading stock index futures An electrical engineering graduate from МГГ whose largely computerized approach to trading has earned his accounts an astounding 250,000 percent return over a sixteen-year period. These are but a sampling of the interviews contained in this book. In his own way, each of the traders interviewed has achieved incredible success. What sets these traders apart? Most people think that winning in the markets has something to do with finding the secret formula. The truth is that any common denominator among the traders I interviewed had more to do with attitude than approach. Some of the traders use fundamental analysis exclusively, others employ only technical analysis, and still others combine the two. Some traders operate on a time horizon measured in hours or even minutes, while others typically implement positions that they intend to hold for months or even years. Although the trading methodologies varied widely, the forthcoming interviews reveal certain important commonalities in trading attitudes and principles. Trading provides one of the last great frontiers of opportunity in our economy. It is one of the very few ways in which an individual can start with a relatively small bankroll and actually become a multimillionaire. Of course, only a handful of individuals (such as those interviewed here) succeed in turning this feat, but at least the opportunity exists. While I hardly expect all readers of this book to transform themselves into super-traders—the world just doesn't work that way—I believe that these thought-provoking interviews will help most serious and open-minded readers improve their personal trading performance. It may even help a select few become super-traders. Jack D. Schwager Goldens Bridge, NY May 1989 4 Acknowledgments First and foremost, I would like to thank Stephen Chronowitz, who pored over every chapter in this book and provided a multitude of helpful suggestions and editing changes. I am indebted to Steve for both the quantity (hours) and quality of his input. I truly believe that whatever the merits of this work, it has benefited significantly from his contributions. I am grateful to my wife, Jo Arm, not only for enduring nine months as a "book widow," but also for being a valuable sounding board—a role she performed with brutal honesty. Sample: "This is the worst thing you ever wrote!" (Needless to say, that item was excised from the book.) Jo Arm possesses common sense in abundance, and I usually followed her advice unquestioningly. Of course, I would like to express my thanks to all the traders who agreed to be interviewed, without whom there would be no book. By and large, these traders neither need nor seek publicity, as they trade only for their own accounts or are already managing all the money they wish to. In many cases, their motives for participating were altruistic. For example, as one trader expressed it, "When I was starting out, I found biographies and interviews of successful traders particularly helpful, and I would like to play a similar role in helping new traders." I wish to express my sincere appreciation to Elaine Crocker for her friendly persuasion, which made some of the chapters in this book possible. For advice, leads, and other assorted favors, I would like to thank Courtney Smith, Norm Zadeh, Susan Abbott, Bruce Babcock, Martin Presler, Chuck Carlson, Leigh Stevens, Brian Gelber, Michael Marcus, and William Rafter. Finally, I would like to thank three traders who were gracious enough to grant me lengthy interviews, which were not incorporated into this book: Irv Kessler, Doug Redmond, and Martin Presler (the former two because, in retrospect, I considered my line of questioning too esoteric and technical; the latter because publication deadlines did not permit time for needed follow-up interviews and editing). 5 Prologue The name of the book was The Big Board. . . . It was about an Earth-ling man and woman who were kidnapped by extraterrestrials. They were put on display in a zoo on a planet called Zircon212. These fictitious people in the zoo had a big board supposedly showing stock market quotations and commodity prices along one wall of their habitat, and a news ticker, and a telephone that was supposedly connected to a brokerage on Earth. The creatures on Zircon-212 told their captives that they had invested a million dollars for them back on Earth, and that it was up to the captives to manage it so that they would be fabulously wealthy when they were returned to Ear
