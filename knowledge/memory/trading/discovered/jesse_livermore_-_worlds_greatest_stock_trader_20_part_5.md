suite when the market opened for trading. He slid the black curtain back across the window and began to study the newspapers again in the darkness. He spoke without looking up. “Harry, we’ll go straight to the office.” Before the automated traffic-light system was installed, a New York City police officer would sit in a booth and operate the lights. When the Livermore limousine approached, this officer would make sure the light was green so Livermore would have no interruptions on his journey from King’s Point to his office in Manhattan. Once a week, Harry the chauffeur would retrace the route, stopping at each traffic-light booth. There he would pass out a cash gratuity to the police officer in charge for the officer’s kind consideration in making sure the financier always had a green light when he passed. Livermore was a person who demanded precision. Livermore exited his car at 730 Fifth Avenue, the Hecksher 8467_Smitten_01_a.qxd 08/14/2001 3:38 PM Page 4 • 4 • JESSE LIVERMORE : WORLD ’ S GREATEST STOCK TRADER Building. He stepped into the private express elevator that stopped on the eighteenth floor, the penthouse. Livermore demanded a straight shot to his office. He chose not to speak with anyone, if he could avoid it. There was no name on the door of Livermore’s office suite. He opened it with his key and entered the small waiting room, an anteroom where Harry Edgar Dache sat during office hours. It was difficult to get past Dache, who stood 6 foot 6, weighed 275 pounds, and was considered by the press to be pug-ugly as well as not very friendly. At this hour, however, the office suite was empty. Livermore was always first. He opened the second door with a special key kept in a safe. Only he and Dache had the combination. Dache even supervised the cleaning people when they cleaned Livermore’s offices. Many considered them the most palatial in New York City, with hand-carved arches, custom bookshelves, and walls paneled in beautiful mahogany and carved oak. Livermore had first seen this paneling in the library of an old English manor house. He had paid to have the paneling dismantled and shipped to New York, where it was reassembled in his offices. The office suite itself consisted of an anteroom; the trading room with its green chalkboard that covered the entire wall, along with the walkway for the board men; the conference room; and finally Livermore’s huge private office. The chalkboard was visible from all the rooms. Livermore usually employed a staff of seven, six board men plus Dache. The primary job of his employees was to post stock quotes on the green chalkboards that stretched the length of the office area. Dache oversaw all activities in the office and did whatever else he was asked. The board men were sworn to secrecy and paid well. The rule in the offices was no talking during market hours.
