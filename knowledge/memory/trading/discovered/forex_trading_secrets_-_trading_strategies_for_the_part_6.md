But I believe that until now, there has never been a book on this unique topic that has so vividly described the subject of the FOREX—a universe completely of its own. The FOREX market is an anonymous entity that bears many faces, and each individual who participates in it leaves a footprint that just might change the course of their personal circumstances based on their individual hopes and dreams for success. This book was written with several purposes in mind. First of all, this book is designed to inform and educate the potential FOREX trader about a field that is growing exponentially around the world and is reaching millions of individuals from all walks of life. It is a market that was reserved for a select few just a decade ago but now is in the hands of anyone, even those without a formal financial education. For this reason, it is very important to include a qualified point of view from a real trader’s perspective, a trader who has already traveled through all the steps and experienced numerous pitfalls but now wants to share this information with you to help you avoid or, at the very least, minimize any potential negative impact through education and solid money management techniques. This book also is intended to provide an overview of all the fundamentals involved in the FOREX and of the trading process so that any new trader can easily obtain all the tools needed to ensure a quick start. It is also aimed at the intermediate trader who has already started the process but could use some guidance and additional tools, with an emphasis on the importance of a solid money management program and the right mind-set to develop a successful trading career. Written from the insider’s perspective of an experienced FOREX trader who has gone through every step until reaching a stable and consistent success, this book is focused on pointing out the potential hazards that every trader will encounter at some point. In the beginning, it will offer xi xii PREFACE solutions to help you understand how to mitigate many of the risks involved by centering on dedicated attention to the preliminary preparation, education, and training needed to become a true professional in this field. The overview includes a history of the FOREX and its basics, as well as a thorough description of all the fundamental, technical, and psychological aspects and how they merge and interact in the market’s behavior. Finally, some of the preferred trading systems are described in detail and discussed as additional elements to help you practice and build your trading toolbox. I hope that you will enjoy this book and its concepts. May it bring you a step closer to becoming a consistent winner and an educated and confident FOREX trader. Acknowledgments As you so often read on the acknowledgments page, the author takes a few brief lines to say thanks. A page of appreciation is in nearly every book and this one is no different; primarily because a project like this is just impossible to successfully complete without the combined effort of an entire team. For me I must give thanks first. I can do everything through Him who gives me strength. — Philippians 4:13 We cannot do it on our own. It is the strength that comes through Jesus Christ that allows us to master the difficult situations of life and to succeed where all human wisdom sees only failure. I was reading through my first book’s acknowledgments (FOREX Made Easy:Six Ways to Trade the Dollar) and noticed that some of my same team is still with me and assisted on this project, so thanks to all. I also noticed that my family is now even bigger; I would not have been able to complete this book if it were not for my absolute significant other, my beautiful wife of more than 10 years. Thanks, Deb, for all the trust and confidence you gave me each and every day. In my last book, I was able to get my son James’ name in the book, so I better add my daughter Jacqueline to this one; I love you both dearly. I, of course, will simply not be able to thank everyone individually for their help, but for the handful of constant contributors I will try. When working to get a book such as this completed it takes lots of reading by lots of people. Jack Lott has been there every step of the way. Thanks Jack for being such a great friend and team member. I know you have read through this book a few hundred times and everyone reading it will appreciate your effort, as I do. I am already looking forward to the next xiii xiv ACKNOWLEDGMENTS project. Michael Thomas has done his fair share of reading of this book and his specific attention to the FOREX strategies will have the reader’s appreciation and understanding. Thanks for all your help and friendship. I would like to give a special thanks to Caroline for her help in getting this project moving and off the ground. Finally and certainly not least, thanks to my publisher McGraw-Hill and the entire team for their dedication of getting this book to you.
