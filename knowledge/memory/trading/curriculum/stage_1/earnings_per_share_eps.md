mastery_reasoning: 'The agent demonstrates solid foundational understanding of EPS:
  correctly defines Basic EPS formula (0.95 confidence), distinguishes Basic vs. Diluted
  EPS, and identifies key trading implications (share buyback effects, dilution risk
  signals). Evidence quality is strong with high-confidence citations (mostly 0.85-0.95).
  The agent identifies concrete edge cases (unprofitable companies, buyback manipulation,
  dilution divergence). However, the mastery criteria requires demonstration of EPS
  application in a ''concrete trading scenario''—while trading implications are listed,
  there''s no actual walkthrough of a specific trade decision using EPS analysis.
  The content stays at generalized implication level rather than scenario-based application.
  Multiple independent source types are present (book + web sources). No unresolved
  contradictions detected. No unsupported low-confidence claims.'

These documents synthesize fundamental valuation metrics (P/E ratios in trailing, forward, absolute, and relative forms) with technical analysis methodologies rooted in Dow Theory. Key themes include using P/E ratios for relative valuation and trend analysis for market timing, while acknowledging limitations of each approach and their complementary applications in trading decisions. Basic EPS is defined as net income minus preferred dividends divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, serving as a critical input for P/E calculations.

**Key concepts:** Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, Trailing P/E (TTM/LTM), Forward P/E, Earnings Per Share (EPS), Basic EPS, Diluted EPS, PEG Ratio, Earnings Yield, Absolute P/E, Relative P/E, Dow Theory, Technical Analysis, Trend Analysis, Support and Resistance, Breakouts, Market Breadth, Advance-Decline Line, Sentiment Analysis, Contrary Opinion, Market Efficiency Hypothesis, Behavioral Finance

**Trading implications:**
- Use trailing P/E for mature, stable companies with consistent earnings history; forward P/E for high-growth companies where future earnings better reflect value
- Forward P/E lower than trailing P/E suggests expected earnings growth
- Use P/E ratios for relative valuation within same-industry comparisons
- Trailing P/E becomes meaningless for unprofitable companies
- Technical analysis tools (support/resistance, breakouts) complement fundamental valuation for market timing
- Rising basic EPS can cause stock price appreciation, but may result from share buybacks rather than genuine earnings growth
- Large divergence between basic and diluted EPS signals potential future dilution risk

**Risk factors:**
- Trailing P/E becomes meaningless for unprofitable companies
- Forward P/E relies on analyst estimates which may be inaccurate
- Basic EPS can increase through share buybacks masking declining absolute earnings
- High potential dilution indicated by large gap between basic and diluted EPS
- Market efficiency debates suggest neither fundamental nor technical analysis guarantees outperformance
- Behavioral finance factors can cause sustained deviations from fundamental value

**Evidence trail:**
- [0.85] Trailing P/E is the most commonly used valuation metric based on historical earnings *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*
- [0.9] Trailing P/E becomes meaningless for unprofitable companies *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*
- [0.85] Forward P/E may be more appropriate for high-growth companies where future earnings better reflect value *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*
- [0.8] Forward P/E lower than trailing P/E suggests expected earnings growth *(source: knowledge/memory/trading/curriculum/stage_1/price-to-earnings_pe_ratio.md)*
- [0.95] Basic EPS = (Net income - preferred dividends) ÷ weighted average of common shares outstanding *(source: Understanding Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS): Definition & Formula)*
- [0.95] Basic EPS does not factor in dilutive effects of convertible securities *(source: Understanding Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS): Definition & Formula)*
- [0.9] Basic EPS will always be higher than diluted EPS since denominator is smaller *(source: Understanding Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS): Definition & Formula)*
- [0.9] Companies can repurchase shares, decreasing share count and spreading net income over fewer shares, causing basic EPS to rise even if absolute earnings decrease *(source: Understanding Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS): Definition & Formula)*
- [0.85] Large divergence between basic and diluted EPS indicates high potential for future shareholder dilution *(source: Understanding Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS): Definition & Formula)*
- [0.85] Technical analysis studies price/volume patterns to forecast trends with foundations in Dow Theory *(source: knowledge/memory/trading/curriculum/stage_1/basic_fa.md)*

**Unresolved conflicts:**
- ⚠️ Basic EPS will always be higher than diluted EPS since the denominator will always be bigger for diluted EPS ↔ Forward P/E lower than trailing P/E suggests expected earnings growth
