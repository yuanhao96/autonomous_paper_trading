mastery_gaps: []
mastery_reasoning: 'The agent shows basic awareness of the PEG Ratio with a high-confidence
  definition (0.95), but fails to meet the mastery criteria of explaining and applying
  PEG Ratio in a concrete trading scenario. The evidence trail contains only a partial
  PEG definition cut off mid-sentence, with no application examples, calculation walkthroughs,
  or trading scenarios. The agent has strong technical analysis integration knowledge
  (0.9 confidence) and understands P/E variants well, but the PEG-specific content
  is minimal—merely defining it as ''P/E divided by growth rate'' without discussing:
  what growth rate period to use (1-year, 5-year), the ''fair value'' threshold of
  1.0, how to interpret PEG >1 vs <1, sector-specific adjustments, or concrete buy/sell
  decisions. The ''Trading implications'' section mentions P/E ratios extensively
  but completely omits PEG Ratio applications. No edge cases or failure modes are
  identified for PEG specifically (e.g., negative earnings, low/negative growth rates,
  analyst estimate reliability issues). Sources are limited to one book series with
  no independent verification.'

## 2026-03-01 — Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 1

These documents synthesize fundamental valuation metrics (P/E ratios in trailing, forward, absolute, and relative forms) with technical analysis methodologies rooted in Dow Theory. The materials emphasize complementary applications of fundamental valuation for stock selection and technical analysis for market timing, while acknowledging ongoing debates about market efficiency and behavioral factors in price formation.

**Key concepts:** Trailing P/E Ratio, Forward P/E Ratio, Earnings Per Share (EPS), PEG Ratio, Earnings Yield, Dow Theory, Trend Analysis, Support and Resistance, Breakouts, Market Breadth, Advance-Decline Line, Sentiment Analysis, Contrary Opinion, Market Efficiency Hypothesis, Behavioral Finance, Point-and-Figure Charts, Candlestick Charts, Absolute P/E, Relative P/E

**Trading implications:**
- Use trailing P/E for mature, stable companies with consistent earnings history; forward P/E for high-growth companies where future earnings estimates are reliable
- Use P/E ratios for relative valuation within same-industry comparisons
- Forward P/E lower than trailing P/E suggests expected earnings growth
- Technical analysis complements fundamental valuation through trend identification for market timing
- Use support/resistance levels and breakouts to determine entry and exit points
- Monitor market breadth indicators (Advance-Decline Line, Arms Index, 90% downside days) for trend confirmation
- Apply contrary opinion sentiment indicators to identify potential market turning points
- Use protective stops and trailing stops to manage risk on breakout trades

**Risk factors:**
- Forward P/E relies on analyst estimates which may be inaccurate or biased
- Traditional advance-decline methods may no longer be profitable in modern markets
- Breakouts can be false ('specialist breakouts') leading to whipsaw losses
- Market efficiency hypothesis challenges the validity of technical patterns
- Fat tails and drawdowns indicate extreme moves occur more frequently than normal distribution predicts
- Crowd behavior and herding can amplify sentiment extremes
- Arbitrage may not always keep prices in equilibrium due to limits to arbitrage
- Relying solely on P/E ratios ignores balance sheet risk and earnings quality issues
