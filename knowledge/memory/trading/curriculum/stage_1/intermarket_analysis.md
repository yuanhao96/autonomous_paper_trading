mastery_gaps: []
mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates solid foundational understanding of intermarket
  analysis concepts, including the four asset classes, correlation thresholds (±0.7),
  inflation/deflation regime impacts, and practical applications like currency diversification
  and using bonds as leading indicators. Evidence quality is strong (mostly 0.8-0.95
  confidence) with multiple source types cited (books by John Murphy, educational
  sites like Investopedia/StockCharts, specialized forex guides). The agent explicitly
  identifies edge cases including correlation instability, regime-dependent relationships,
  and liquidity variations. However, mastery criteria requires demonstration in a
  'concrete trading scenario'—while trading implications are listed, there is no worked
  example showing step-by-step application. Three unresolved contradictions are flagged
  (though two appear to be partial duplicates), indicating the agent recognizes conceptual
  tensions but hasn't resolved them. The 'fatal error' claim about single-currency
  exposure (0.8 confidence) and some forex-specific claims (0.8-0.85) are slightly
  below top-tier evidence standards.

Intermarket analysis examines correlations between four major asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies) to predict market movements and validate trading decisions. Currency diversification is emphasized as essential protection against government-induced inflation, with forex markets providing early warning signals for other markets. Correlation relationships shift based on inflationary versus deflationary environments, requiring continuous monitoring.

**Key concepts:** Intermarket analysis, Asset class correlation, Currency diversification, Inflation hedge, Carry trade, Positive/negative correlation, Four asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies), John Murphy, Trading sessions (Tokyo, London, New York), Foreign exchange risk types (transaction, translation, economic)

**Trading implications:**
- Maintain multi-currency exposure to hedge against government debt devaluation and inflation
- Use correlation studies (±0.7 threshold for statistical significance) to confirm trend direction or signal reversals
- Monitor commodity prices for early signals in currency and equity markets
- Apply intermarket analysis with other tools rather than as standalone strategy
- Use liquid markets (e.g., US bond futures) to hedge illiquid positions
- Track bond price direction changes as potential leading indicators for stock price shifts

**Risk factors:**
- Correlation instability—relationships can shift from positive to negative making them unreliable
- Single-currency concentration described as 'fatal error' under current monetary policies
- Leverage risks in forex trading
- Liquidity variations across trading sessions
- Inflation and interest rate risks affecting fixed income
- Changing economic conditions altering previously stable correlations
- Unstable correlations that swing between positive and negative values

**Unresolved conflicts:**
- ⚠️ If a correlation moves from positive to negative, the relationship is unstable and not useful for trading ↔ Stocks and bonds typically have negative correlation when inflation is low and economy is stable, but positive correlation when inflation is high
- ⚠️ If a correlation moves from positive to negative, the relationship is unstable and not useful for trading ↔ A correlation of +0.7 or greater or -0.7 or lower is statistically significant
- ⚠️ If a correlation moves from positive to negative, the relationship is unstable and not useful for trading ↔ Stocks and bonds typically have negative correlation in low inflation/stable economy but positive correlation in high inflation
