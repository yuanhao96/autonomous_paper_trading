mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates solid theoretical understanding of trend
  identification, support/resistance, and basic volume analysis, meeting the core
  mastery criteria conceptually. The notes show practical trading implications (entry
  near support, stop-loss placement, volume confirmation) and identify key risk factors
  including false breakouts and subjective interpretation. However, the content is
  limited to a single source (one textbook), lacks explicit identification of edge
  cases beyond generic warnings, and shows no evidence of actual chart application
  or multi-timeframe analysis in practice. The confidence level appears reasonable
  throughout with appropriate hedging ('not exact science'). The mastery criteria
  of 'can identify trend direction and key levels on a chart' is partially met theoretically
  but not demonstrated through actual chart analysis.

## 2026-02-25 — Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 1

Technical analysis relies on trend identification, support/resistance levels, and market psychology to guide trading decisions, with support representing price floors where buying interest emerges. While originally dismissed by mainstream finance, technical analysis has become dominant among practitioners, though it requires combining multiple indicators and managing risks of false breakouts and subjective interpretation.

**Key concepts:** Support level: price point where asset struggles to fall below due to buyer interest, Resistance level: price ceiling where supply prevents further upward movement, Trend: directional price movement identified through peaks and troughs, Dow Theory: foundational framework with primary, secondary, and minor trends, Breakout: price movement beyond support/resistance signaling potential trend change, Market sentiment: collective psychology of market participants, Market breadth: measure of overall market strength via advance-decline data, Point-and-figure charts: price-focused charting method ignoring time, Wyckoff Method: institutional trading approach based on supply/demand analysis, Behavioral finance: psychological factors influencing price action

**Trading implications:**
- Buy near support levels with confirmation from additional technical indicators
- Use support bands rather than single lines to avoid missed executions
- Set stop-loss orders below support to limit downside on false breakouts
- Monitor volume to confirm validity of support/resistance breaks
- Apply trailing stops to protect profits in trending markets
- Use contrary opinion indicators when sentiment reaches extremes
- Wait for retracement after breakout to improve risk/reward ratio
- Combine multiple timeframes for support/resistance confirmation

**Risk factors:**
- Support levels can shift; previously established floors may not hold
- False breakouts ('specialist breakouts') can trigger premature entries
- Volatile price action may briefly dip below support without true breakdown
- Over-reliance on single indicators increases false signal risk
- Technical analysis is not exact science; precision is difficult
- Crowd behavior can create self-fulfilling but unstable patterns
- Random walk hypothesis challenges predictive validity of patterns
- Fat tails and drawdowns occur more frequently than normal distribution predicts
