mastery_gaps: []
mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates basic awareness of P/E ratio concepts and
  some practical trading implications, but fails to meet the mastery criteria of evaluating
  whether a stock is overvalued using basic ratios. The learned content covers P/E
  variations (trailing, forward, relative) and mentions PEG ratio and sector comparisons,
  but critically omits P/B ratio, revenue growth analysis, and balance sheet basics
  which are explicitly listed in the topic description. The agent can explain P/E
  concepts but lacks demonstrated ability to synthesize multiple valuation metrics
  for overvaluation assessment. No evidence of citing multiple independent source
  types. Edge cases are well-identified (zero/negative earnings, accounting manipulation,
  cross-industry comparisons). No clear contradictions detected. Confidence levels
  not explicitly stated, so no penalty applied for unsupported assertions.

## 2026-02-25 — Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples

The documents cover fundamental valuation metrics (P/E ratio) and technical analysis methodologies. P/E ratios compare stock prices to earnings for valuation, with variations including trailing, forward, absolute, and relative forms. Technical analysis studies price/volume patterns to forecast trends, with roots in Dow Theory and trend identification through charts, support/resistance, and breakouts. The materials highlight ongoing debates about market efficiency and the complementary nature of fundamental and technical approaches.

**Key concepts:** Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, Trailing P/E, Forward P/E, Earnings Per Share (EPS), PEG Ratio, Earnings Yield, Technical Analysis, Trend Analysis, Dow Theory, Support and Resistance, Breakouts, Market Efficiency Hypothesis, Behavioral Finance, Point-and-Figure Charts, Candlestick Charts, Sentiment Analysis, Market Breadth

**Trading implications:**
- P/E ratio of 10 or below may indicate value entry points with technical support convergence
- Compare P/E ratios only within same sector/industry for valid valuation
- Forward P/E lower than trailing P/E suggests expected earnings growth acceleration
- Use PEG ratio < 1 as potential undervalued growth signal
- Trailing P/E provides objective historical baseline while forward P/E reflects growth expectations
- Trend identification through peaks/troughs analysis enables directional positioning
- Breakout confirmation with volume validates trend continuation entries
- Support/resistance levels at round numbers create actionable price zones
- Combine fundamental P/E screening with technical chart support for hybrid entry strategy
- Stops (protective, trailing, time-based) essential for breakout trade risk management

**Risk factors:**
- Companies with zero/negative earnings have no meaningful P/E (N/A)
- Forward P/E relies on potentially manipulated or inaccurate earnings guidance
- Trailing P/E becomes stale between quarterly earnings releases
- Cross-industry P/E comparisons misleading due to different growth/earnings profiles
- Accounting manipulation can distort reported EPS and P/E reliability
- Debt levels affect P/E ratios through leverage, creating comparability issues
- Technical analysis efficacy disputed by efficient-market hypothesis
- Breakout failures ('specialist breakouts') require stop-loss discipline
- Market sentiment extremes may contrarian signal but timing remains uncertain
- Historical patterns may not predict future price movements
