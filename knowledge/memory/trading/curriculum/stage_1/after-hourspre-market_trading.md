mastery_gaps: []
mastery_reasoning: 'The agent demonstrates solid foundational knowledge of after-hours/pre-market
  trading mechanics, including specific time windows (4-8 PM and 4-9:30 AM ET), ECN
  functionality, liquidity risks, and practical order-type restrictions. The trading
  implications show application awareness (limit orders only, reduced position sizes,
  earnings reaction timing). However, mastery criteria requires demonstration in a
  ''concrete trading scenario,'' which is absent—no walkthrough of an actual trade
  decision using pre-market/after-hours data exists. The content lists implications
  abstractly rather than applying them narratively. Evidence quality is moderate:
  single source type (curriculum notes), no explicit edge case identification beyond
  general risk lists, and no unsupported assertions requiring penalty. The +0.05 for
  edge cases is not awarded because risk factors are listed generically rather than
  analyzed as failure modes in specific scenarios.'

## 2026-02-25 — knowledge/memory/trading/curriculum/stage_1/market_hours.md

The documents synthesize global market hours and extended trading mechanics across forex and equity markets, emphasizing that session overlaps (particularly London-New York) generate peak volatility and liquidity, while after-hours trading through ECNs offers flexibility but carries significant risks including thin liquidity, wide spreads, and limited order types. The forex market operates nearly 24/5 with continuous interbank trading, whereas equity extended hours (4-8 PM and 4-9:30 AM ET) are characterized by lower participation and heightened price volatility.

**Key concepts:** Trading sessions (Tokyo/Asian, London/European, New York/North American), Session overlaps, After-hours/pre-market trading, ECNs (Electronic Communication Networks), Liquidity and volatility patterns, Price discovery, Earnings plays, 24-hour forex market, Interbank currency market, Bid-ask spreads, Limit orders vs market orders

**Trading implications:**
- Trade during London-New York overlap (8 AM-12 PM ET) for highest forex volatility and volume
- Use pre-market futures monitoring (especially E-mini S&P 500) to gauge market sentiment before regular session opens
- React immediately to earnings announcements in first 30 minutes of after-hours (4-4:30 PM ET) when volume is highest
- Employ limit orders exclusively during extended hours to protect against wide spreads and slippage
- Reduce position sizes during extended hours due to liquidity constraints
- Monitor Asian market closes during early pre-market (5-7 AM ET) for currency pair movements
- Avoid stop-loss orders in extended hours—use price alerts for manual execution instead

**Risk factors:**
- Thin markets with fewer participants during extended hours
- Wider bid-ask spreads increasing transaction costs
- Increased volatility from low liquidity
- Limited information availability with reduced analyst coverage
- Inability to use stop-loss and stop-limit orders in most extended hours sessions
- Price uncertainty—after-hours prices may not reflect next day's opening
- Competition from institutional/professional traders with superior data access
- Computer delays and ECN technical failures
- Partial fills common due to illiquidity
- Orders may expire same session rather than carry over
