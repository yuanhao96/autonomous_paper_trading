mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates basic awareness of asset classes and mentions
  correlation concepts, but falls short of the mastery criteria which requires describing
  correlation patterns between major asset classes. The content mentions 'intermarket
  analysis reveals correlations' and 'diversify across uncorrelated classes' but provides
  no actual correlation patterns (e.g., equity-bond correlations, commodity-equity
  relationships, forex-equity links). The knowledge appears to be from a single source
  type (book excerpt) with no multiple independent sources. While the agent lists
  relevant key concepts, there's no demonstrated ability to describe how these asset
  classes actually correlate with each other in practice—only generic statements about
  diversification benefits. The trading implications are sensible but don't demonstrate
  mastery of correlation patterns.

Forex markets provide currency diversification and potential for risk-adjusted returns, with governments using inflation to reduce debt burdens making multi-currency exposure essential. Asset classes group investments with similar characteristics and market behaviors, with diversification across uncorrelated classes reducing portfolio risk. Intermarket analysis reveals correlations between markets that can be exploited for trading advantages, while fixed income securities offer predictable income streams but face inflation and interest rate risks.

**Key concepts:** Asset class, Forex diversification, Currency depreciation, Inverse price/yield relationship, Intermarket analysis, Carry trade, Correlation, Fixed income, Equities, Inflation hedge, Risk-adjusted returns, Capital gains, Dividend income, Alternative investments

**Trading implications:**
- Maintain multi-currency exposure to hedge against government-induced inflation
- Use longer-term holding periods and specific instruments to reduce forex trading risk
- Incorporate intermarket correlations into trading systems for predictive advantage
- Diversify across uncorrelated asset classes to reduce portfolio risk
- Consider carry trades and income vehicles in appreciating currencies for steady yields
- Monitor forex markets for early warnings of changes in other markets

**Risk factors:**
- Government currency devaluation through inflation
- Concentration risk from single-currency asset holdings
- Interest rate risk affecting bond valuations
- Inflation eroding real returns on fixed income
- High leverage in forex and derivatives trading
- Illiquidity in alternative asset classes
- Model risk in intermarket trading systems
- Tax inefficiency in dividend income from index funds
