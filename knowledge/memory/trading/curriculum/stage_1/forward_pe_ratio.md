mastery_gaps: []
mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates solid conceptual understanding of Forward
  P/E ratio, including its definition, comparison to Trailing P/E, and basic application
  (using it for growth assessment when forward P/E < trailing P/E). Evidence quality
  is strong with multiple high-confidence citations (0.8-0.95). However, the mastery
  criteria requires demonstration in a 'concrete trading scenario,' which is absent.
  The 'Trading implications' section provides general rules but no specific, step-by-step
  trading example with entry/exit criteria, position sizing, or risk management. The
  agent identifies key risk factors (analyst optimism, unprofitable companies) which
  partially satisfies edge case identification (+0.05), and sources are primarily
  from one textbook type (no independent source type reward). No significant contradictions
  or low-confidence claims detected.

## 2026-02-26 — Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 2

The documents synthesize fundamental valuation metrics (P/E ratios in trailing, forward, absolute, and relative forms) with technical analysis methodologies rooted in Dow Theory. Key themes include using trailing P/E for mature companies with stable earnings history and forward P/E for growth assessment, while technical analysis complements valuation through trend identification, support/resistance levels, and market sentiment indicators.

**Key concepts:** Trailing P/E Ratio, Forward P/E Ratio, Earnings Per Share (EPS), Basic EPS, Diluted EPS, PEG Ratio, Earnings Yield, Absolute P/E, Relative P/E, Dow Theory, Technical Analysis, Trend Analysis, Support and Resistance, Breakouts, Market Breadth, Advance-Decline Line, Sentiment Analysis, Contrary Opinion, Market Efficiency Hypothesis, Behavioral Finance, Point-and-Figure Charts

**Trading implications:**
- Use trailing P/E for mature, stable companies with consistent earnings history; forward P/E for high-growth companies where future earnings better reflect value
- Forward P/E lower than trailing P/E suggests expected earnings growth
- Use P/E ratios for relative valuation within same-industry comparisons
- Technical analysis complements fundamental valuation through trend identification, support/resistance levels, breakouts, and market sentiment indicators
- Trailing P/E becomes meaningless for unprofitable companies

**Risk factors:**
- Forward P/E ratios may be too optimistic due to analyst estimate errors
- Trailing P/E based on historical data may not reflect future performance
- Companies with no earnings or losing money have no meaningful P/E ratio
- Traditional advance-decline methods may no longer be profitable
- Ongoing debates about market efficiency challenge technical analysis validity
