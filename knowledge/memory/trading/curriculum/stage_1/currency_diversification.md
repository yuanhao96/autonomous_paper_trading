mastery_gaps: []
mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates solid foundational understanding of currency
  diversification concepts, including protection against inflation/debt devaluation,
  carry trades, hedging instruments, and correlation structures between currency pairs.
  However, while the agent can explain the concept well, the 'Trading implications'
  section remains somewhat generic and lacks a truly concrete, step-by-step trading
  scenario application as required by the mastery criteria. The evidence quality is
  strong (mostly 0.85-0.95 confidence) and sourced from a coherent book series, but
  there's limited diversity in source types (primarily one book series plus one web
  article). The agent identifies risk factors well but doesn't fully articulate edge
  cases or failure modes with specific numerical examples. No significant contradictions
  are present. The agent receives +0.05 for risk factor identification but loses -0.1
  for not demonstrably meeting the 'concrete trading scenario' application requirement.

Currency diversification is essential for protecting wealth against government-induced inflation and debt devaluation strategies, with forex markets offering early warning signals, risk-adjusted returns through carry trades, and hedging instruments. Multiple sources emphasize that concentrated single-currency exposure represents a 'fatal error' given current monetary policies, while proper diversification requires understanding correlations between major, minor, and exotic currency pairs.

**Key concepts:** Currency diversification, Foreign exchange risk, Carry trade, Inflation hedge, Transaction risk, Translation risk, Economic risk, Intermarket analysis, Asset class correlation, Currency depreciation, Inverse price/yield relationship, Hedging, Trading sessions, Liquidity, Leverage

**Trading implications:**
- Maintain multi-currency exposure to hedge against government debt devaluation through inflation
- Use forex markets as early warning system for other market movements
- Implement carry trades for income yield in stable trending currencies
- Diversify across major, minor, and exotic pairs with attention to correlation structures
- Employ forward contracts and options for hedging transaction, translation, and economic risks
- Monitor three major trading sessions (Tokyo, London, New York) for liquidity and volatility variations
- Ride stable long-term forex trends for capital gains while managing leverage risk

**Risk factors:**
- Government-induced inflation eroding single-currency holdings
- Concentrated currency exposure described as 'especially fatal error'
- Foreign exchange risk manifesting as transaction, translation, and economic risk
- Inverse relationship between currencies creates correlation risk
- Leverage amplification in forex markets
- Short-term high-risk speculation dominating forex markets
- Interest rate and duration risk in fixed income hedging instruments
