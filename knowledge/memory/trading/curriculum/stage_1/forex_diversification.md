mastery_gaps: []
mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates solid theoretical understanding of forex
  diversification concepts including currency diversification benefits, forex risk
  types (transaction/translation/economic), hedging instruments, and session-based
  trading. Evidence quality is generally strong (most claims 0.75-0.95 confidence)
  with multiple coherent sources. However, the mastery criteria requires demonstration
  in a 'concrete trading scenario' which is absent—while trading implications are
  listed, there's no walkthrough of an actual portfolio construction or trade execution
  example. The agent identifies risk factors and edge cases (leverage amplification,
  session liquidity variations, government inflation policies) earning the +0.05 reward.
  Sources appear consistent with no contradictions. Multiple source types are not
  explicitly differentiated (all appear to be book/web excerpts without clear arxiv/academic
  distinction). The gap between theoretical knowledge and concrete application prevents
  reaching the 0.7 'can apply in practice' threshold.

Multiple sources emphasize currency diversification as essential protection against government-induced inflation and debt devaluation strategies. Forex markets offer early warning signals for other markets, with three major trading sessions (Tokyo, London, New York) providing varying liquidity and volatility. Foreign exchange risk manifests as transaction, translation, and economic risk, requiring hedging strategies like forward contracts and options. Asset class diversification across uncorrelated instruments, including forex carry trades and multi-currency exposure, improves risk-adjusted returns.

**Key concepts:** Currency diversification, Foreign exchange risk, Transaction risk, Translation risk, Economic risk, Carry trade, Intermarket analysis, Trading sessions, Hedging, Inflation hedge, Asset class correlation, Liquidity, Leverage, Pip value

**Trading implications:**
- Maintain multi-currency exposure to hedge against single-currency depreciation and government inflation policies
- Use forex markets as early warning indicators for equity and commodity market movements
- Trade during session overlaps (especially London-New York) for optimal liquidity and volatility
- Implement carry trades in stable, high-yielding currencies for income generation
- Apply hedging instruments (forwards, options, hedged ETFs) to manage currency risk in international portfolios
- Keep losses per trade low due to asymmetric mathematics of recovery from drawdowns

**Risk factors:**
- Government inflation policies eroding real value of debt-denominated currencies
- Transaction risk from contract signing to settlement currency fluctuations
- Translation risk for multinational corporations consolidating foreign subsidiary financials
- Economic risk from continuous currency fluctuation impacts on market valuation
- Low liquidity during after-hours and certain forex sessions
- Leverage amplification of losses exceeding initial deposits
- High volatility during session transitions and major economic announcements
