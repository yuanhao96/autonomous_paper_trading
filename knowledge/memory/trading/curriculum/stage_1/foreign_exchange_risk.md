mastery_gaps: []
mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates solid conceptual understanding of foreign
  exchange risk, correctly identifying the three main types (transaction, translation,
  economic) with high-confidence evidence (0.85-0.95). The knowledge covers hedging
  instruments, diversification rationale, and trading implications. However, the mastery
  criteria requires ability to 'explain and apply Foreign exchange risk in a concrete
  trading scenario'—this is not demonstrably met. While trading implications are listed,
  they remain generic bullet points rather than a worked-through scenario showing
  application. The evidence quality is generally strong (mostly 0.8+ confidence) with
  multiple source types (Wikipedia, specialized forex guides), earning the source
  diversity reward. Edge cases and failure modes are partially identified (currency
  crises, leverage amplification, contingent risk). No significant contradictions
  or low-confidence claims detected.

Foreign exchange risk encompasses transaction, translation, and economic risks arising from currency fluctuations, with hedging strategies including forwards, options, and natural hedging essential for mitigation. Currency diversification serves as critical protection against inflation and government debt devaluation, while forex markets provide early warning signals and intermarket analysis opportunities across global trading sessions.

**Key concepts:** Foreign exchange risk (FX risk), Transaction risk, Translation risk, Economic risk (forecast risk), Contingent risk, Currency diversification, Carry trade, Hedging, Forward contracts, Options, Natural hedging, Value at risk (VaR), Trading sessions (Tokyo/London/New York), Intermarket analysis, Functional currency, Balance sheet hedge

**Trading implications:**
- Maintain multi-currency exposure to hedge against government-induced inflation and debt devaluation
- Use forex markets as early warning signals for other asset classes
- Implement carry trades for risk-adjusted returns in properly diversified portfolios
- Apply forward contracts and options to hedge transaction exposure
- Utilize trailing stops and proper position sizing to manage forex-specific volatility
- Exploit arbitrage opportunities across retail and wholesale market tiers
- Leverage three major trading sessions for varying liquidity and volatility conditions

**Risk factors:**
- Concentrated single-currency exposure described as 'fatal error' under current monetary policies
- Leverage amplification of losses in short time periods
- Currency crises potential (historical precedents: Mexican peso, Asian crisis, Russian 1998, Argentine crises)
- Contingent risk from uncertain contract outcomes
- Translation risk impact on reported earnings and stock prices
- Economic risk affecting market value and competitive position
- Operational risks from netting and natural hedging complexity
- Political and regulatory instability in foreign jurisdictions
