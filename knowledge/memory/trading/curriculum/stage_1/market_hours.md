mastery_reasoning: 'The agent demonstrates solid practical understanding of liquidity
  differences across sessions, meeting the mastery criteria. Evidence shows clear
  comprehension of: (1) the London-New York overlap as highest liquidity/volatility
  period, (2) Asian session''s range-bound characteristics with lower liquidity, (3)
  after-hours thin liquidity risks with wider spreads and slippage, and (4) specific
  order type adaptations (limit vs. market orders) based on liquidity conditions.
  The agent identifies multiple edge cases including gap risk, partial fills, information
  asymmetry, and operational risks in 24-hour markets. However, the source appears
  to be a single consolidated document (binary options strategies) rather than multiple
  independent source types. No unsupported assertions or contradictions are evident.
  The coverage lacks deeper institutional mechanics (e.g., how dark pools interact
  with session liquidity) and could benefit from more quantitative treatment of spread
  widening (specific basis point ranges).'

The documents cover trading session dynamics across forex and equity markets, emphasizing that market activity varies significantly by time of day. Key themes include: the three major forex sessions (Tokyo, London, New York) with their distinct characteristics; the importance of session overlaps for volatility and liquidity; after-hours trading mechanics in equities with associated risks; and upcoming structural changes like Nasdaq's planned 24-hour trading. Price action principles based on supply and demand are time-frame independent, while liquidity patterns differ substantially between regular and extended hours.

**Key concepts:** Trading sessions (Tokyo/Asian, London/European, New York/North American, Sydney), Session overlaps (London-New York, Tokyo-London, Sydney-Tokyo), After-hours/pre-market trading, ECNs (Electronic Communication Networks), Liquidity and volatility patterns, Price discovery mechanisms, Opening and closing auctions, 24-hour trading, Supply and demand as universal price drivers, Capital flows and trade flows

**Trading implications:**
- Trade during London-New York overlap (13:00-16:00 UTC) for highest volatility and liquidity
- Use Asian session for range-bound strategies and technical analysis
- Avoid market orders in after-hours; use limit orders only
- Reduce position size during thin liquidity periods
- Monitor economic data releases aligned with their respective sessions
- Set alerts 15 minutes before high-volatility overlaps
- Expect wider spreads and slippage in extended hours
- Use session-based support/resistance levels for entry/exit decisions

**Risk factors:**
- Thin liquidity in after-hours leading to extreme volatility
- Wider bid-ask spreads during non-core sessions
- Partial fills and execution uncertainty in extended hours
- Information asymmetry with institutional traders in after-hours
- Overtrading risk in 24-hour markets without natural breaks
- Operational risks (system outages, security breaches) in continuous trading
- Loss of price discovery anchors without opening/closing auctions
- Gap risk between sessions in 24/5 markets
