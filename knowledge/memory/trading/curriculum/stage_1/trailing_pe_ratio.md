mastery_reasoning: 'The agent demonstrates solid conceptual understanding of Trailing
  P/E Ratio—defining it correctly as current price divided by TTM/LTM EPS, explaining
  its objectivity advantage, and distinguishing it appropriately from Forward P/E.
  The agent shows practical application awareness by identifying when to use trailing
  vs. forward P/E (mature stable companies vs. high-growth), interpreting the trailing/forward
  P/E spread as a growth signal, and noting sector-relative comparison requirements.
  However, mastery falls short of 0.7 because: (1) No concrete trading scenario is
  actually walked through—only generic ''use cases'' are listed without position sizing,
  entry/exit logic, or a specific example; (2) The evidence trail shows strong confidence
  scores (0.85-0.95) but relies heavily on Investopedia/CNBC (similar source types),
  lacking academic or practitioner depth; (3) Risk factors are enumerated but not
  integrated into a coherent decision framework. The +0.05 for edge cases (unprofitable
  companies, earnings manipulation, lag effects) is offset by -0.1 for failing to
  demonstrably meet the ''concrete trading scenario'' mastery criterion.'

## 2026-02-26 — Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3

These documents synthesize fundamental valuation metrics—primarily P/E ratios in trailing, forward, absolute, and relative forms—with technical analysis methodologies rooted in Dow Theory. The materials emphasize that trailing P/E uses historical 12-month earnings for objective valuation of mature companies, while forward P/E incorporates analyst estimates for growth assessment, with Wall Street generally preferring forward-looking metrics. Technical analysis complements fundamental valuation through trend identification, support/resistance levels, breakouts, and market sentiment indicators, acknowledging ongoing debates about market efficiency and behavioral factors.

**Key concepts:** Trailing P/E Ratio, Forward P/E Ratio, Earnings Per Share (EPS), Dow Theory, Support and Resistance, Trend Analysis, Breakouts, PEG Ratio, Earnings Yield, Relative P/E, Absolute P/E, Point-and-Figure Charts, Market Efficiency Hypothesis, Behavioral Finance, Advance-Decline Line, Contrary Opinion

**Trading implications:**
- Use trailing P/E for mature, stable companies with consistent earnings history; forward P/E for high-growth companies where future earnings better reflect value
- Forward P/E lower than trailing P/E suggests expected earnings growth; higher forward P/E suggests expected earnings decline
- Use P/E ratios for relative valuation within same-industry comparisons, not across sectors
- Confirm breakouts with volume and price action before entering positions
- Use trailing P/E to grade management execution against historical targets
- Employ stop-loss orders (protective, trailing, time-based) to manage breakout trade risks
- Combine fundamental valuation with technical trend analysis for market timing decisions

**Risk factors:**
- Forward P/E relies on estimates that may be overly optimistic or manipulated by management to beat expectations
- Trailing P/E becomes meaningless for unprofitable companies (N/A or negative)
- P/E ratios are not comparable across different sectors due to varying growth rates and business models
- External analyst estimates may diverge from company guidance, creating confusion
- Companies with debt may show skewed P/E ratios due to leverage effects
- Breakout trades carry risk of false breakouts ('specialist breakouts') requiring stop placement strategies
- Earnings manipulation risk requires trusting company-reported data
- Stock prices change constantly while earnings are reported quarterly, causing trailing P/E lag

**Evidence trail:**
- [0.95] Trailing P/E is calculated by dividing current stock price by EPS over the past 12 months (TTM/LTM) *(source: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples (Investopedia))*
- [0.95] Forward P/E uses future earnings guidance rather than trailing figures *(source: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples (Investopedia))*
- [0.9] Trailing P/E is the most popular P/E metric because it's thought to be objective *(source: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples (Investopedia))*
- [0.85] Wall Street's preferred metric to value companies is the forward P/E ratio *(source: Trailing P/E vs. forward P/E: what investors need to know to value stocks (CNBC))*
- [0.9] If trailing P/E is greater than forward P/E, it points to earnings growth ahead *(source: Trailing P/E vs. forward P/E: what investors need to know to value stocks (CNBC))*
- [0.95] P/E ratios are most valuable when comparing similar companies in the same industry *(source: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples (Investopedia))*
- [0.85] A PEG ratio less than one is typically considered undervalued *(source: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples (Investopedia))*
- [0.9] Trend analysis is based on Dow Theory principles of peaks and troughs *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*
- [0.85] Support and resistance levels occur due to investor psychology and memory of past price levels *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*
- [0.9] Breakouts should be confirmed before trading to avoid false signals *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*

**Unresolved conflicts:**
- ⚠️ If forward P/E is lower than trailing P/E, analysts expect earnings to increase ↔ Companies with no earnings or negative earnings don't have a P/E ratio (N/A)
