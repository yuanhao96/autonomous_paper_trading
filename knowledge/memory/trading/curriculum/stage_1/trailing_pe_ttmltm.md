mastery_gaps: []
mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates solid understanding of Trailing P/E (TTM/LTM)
  with clear explanations of calculation methodology, reliability advantages over
  forward P/E, and appropriate use cases (mature companies vs. growth companies).
  The evidence quality is strong with multiple high-confidence citations (0.9-0.95)
  from Investopedia and Bitget. The agent successfully identifies edge cases (unprofitable
  companies, past performance not predicting future) and failure modes (EPS constant
  while prices fluctuate). However, the mastery criteria requires demonstrating application
  in a 'concrete trading scenario,' which is only partially met—while the agent lists
  trading implications abstractly, there is no walkthrough of an actual trade decision
  using Trailing P/E with specific numbers, entry/exit points, or position sizing.
  The technical analysis integration mentions stops and breakouts but doesn't concretely
  show how Trailing P/E would trigger or validate a specific trade. Multiple independent
  source types are present (book, web), earning +0.05. Edge cases are explicitly identified
  (+0.05). Base score 0.5 (can explain) + 0.1 (partial application) + 0.1 (source
  diversity and edge cases) - 0.1 (mastery criteria not fully met) = 0.65.

## 2026-03-01 — Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3

The documents synthesize fundamental valuation metrics (P/E ratios in trailing, forward, absolute, and relative forms) with technical analysis methodologies rooted in Dow Theory. Trailing P/E uses actual past 12-month earnings for objective valuation of mature companies, while forward P/E incorporates analyst estimates for growth assessment. Technical analysis complements fundamental valuation through trend identification, support/resistance levels, breakouts, and market sentiment indicators, with ongoing debates about market efficiency and behavioral factors.

**Key concepts:** Trailing P/E Ratio, Forward P/E Ratio, Earnings Per Share (EPS), TTM/LTM Earnings, Dow Theory, Trend Analysis, Support and Resistance, Breakouts, PEG Ratio, Earnings Yield, Absolute P/E, Relative P/E, Point-and-Figure Charts, Market Efficiency Hypothesis, Behavioral Finance

**Trading implications:**
- Use trailing P/E for mature, stable companies with consistent earnings history; forward P/E for high-growth companies where future earnings better reflect value
- Trailing P/E becomes meaningless for unprofitable companies; forward P/E may be more appropriate in such cases
- Technical analysis complements fundamental valuation through trend identification, support/resistance levels, and breakouts for market timing
- Compare both trailing and forward P/E ratios to identify expected earnings growth trajectories and potential mispricing
- Use stops (entry, exit, protective, trailing, time, money) to manage breakout trading risk and false breakout scenarios

**Risk factors:**
- Trailing P/E based on past performance does not signal future behavior; company performance factors change over time
- Forward P/E relies on estimated future earnings, subject to miscalculation, analyst bias, and potential company manipulation of estimates
- External analyst estimates may diverge from company estimates, creating confusion
- Companies might underestimate or misstate earnings to beat consensus estimates
- Forward P/E is an estimate and could be optimistic—investors should approach with caution
- High trailing P/E could indicate overvaluation or expected future growth; context and peer comparison essential

**Evidence trail:**
- [0.95] Trailing P/E is calculated by dividing current share price by EPS over the previous 12 months *(source: Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E: What's the Difference? - Investopedia)*
- [0.95] Forward P/E estimates a company's likely EPS for the next 12 months *(source: Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E: What's the Difference? - Investopedia)*
- [0.9] Trailing P/E is considered more reliable as it is based on actual performance rather than expected future performance *(source: Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E: What's the Difference? - Investopedia)*
- [0.9] Trailing P/E has shortcomings: past performance does not signal future behavior, and EPS remains constant while stock prices fluctuate *(source: Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E: What's the Difference? - Investopedia)*
- [0.9] Forward P/E is favored by analysts who believe investment decisions are better made based on estimates of future rather than past performance *(source: Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E: What's the Difference? - Investopedia)*
- [0.95] TTM refers to the sum of a company's financial results over the most recent 12-month period *(source: what does ttm mean in stocks: Trailing Twelve Months - Bitget)*
- [0.9] Trend analysis is based on Dow Theory and uses peaks and troughs to determine market direction *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*
- [0.85] Support and resistance levels occur due to investor psychology and memory of past price levels *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*
- [0.9] Multiple stop types exist: entry, exit, protective, trailing, time, and money stops *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*
- [0.85] Breakouts can be confirmed through volume analysis and price thresholds; false breakouts require specialized stop placement *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3)*
