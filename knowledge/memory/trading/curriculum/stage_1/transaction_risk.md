mastery_reasoning: 'The agent demonstrates basic-to-intermediate understanding of
  transaction risk. It correctly identifies transaction risk as one of three FX risk
  types (transaction, translation, economic) and notes key characteristics: it increases
  with time between contract entry and settlement, and is short-term to medium-term
  in nature. Evidence quality is generally solid (0.85-0.95 confidence) with specific
  citations. However, the agent fails to meet the mastery criteria of ''applying Transaction
  risk in a concrete trading scenario''—there is no worked example, numerical illustration,
  or step-by-step application showing how to identify, measure, or hedge transaction
  risk in practice. The content mentions hedging instruments (forwards, options) but
  doesn''t connect them specifically to transaction risk mitigation in a scenario.
  The agent also doesn''t explicitly identify edge cases or failure modes for transaction
  risk specifically.'

Foreign exchange markets operate 24/5 across global trading sessions with $9.6 trillion daily volume, offering currency diversification as protection against inflation and debt devaluation. Three types of FX risk (transaction, translation, economic) require hedging through forwards, options, and natural hedging, while intermarket analysis using forex as early warning signals can improve risk-adjusted returns.

**Key concepts:** Currency diversification, Foreign exchange risk, Transaction risk, Translation risk, Economic risk, Carry trade, Intermarket analysis, Trading sessions, Hedging, Forward contracts, Options, Natural hedging, Liquidity, Volatility, Asset class correlation

**Trading implications:**
- Maintain multi-currency exposure to hedge against government-induced inflation and debt devaluation
- Trade during London-New York session overlap for peak liquidity and volatility
- Use forex markets as early warning signals for other asset classes
- Implement carry trades for risk-adjusted returns when interest rate differentials exist
- Apply forward contracts and options to hedge transaction and translation risks
- Monitor correlation shifts between asset classes based on inflationary/deflationary environments

**Risk factors:**
- Concentrated single-currency exposure described as 'fatal error' under current monetary policies
- Transaction risk increases with time between contract entry and settlement
- Translation risk from subsidiary financial statement conversion
- Economic risk from continuous market value exposure to currency fluctuations
- Liquidity deterioration in thin markets with wider spreads and slippage
- Leverage amplifies both gains and losses in carry trades
- Execution quality degradation during extended-hours/ECN trading
