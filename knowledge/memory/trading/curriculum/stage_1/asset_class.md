mastery_reasoning: 'The agent demonstrates solid foundational understanding of asset
  class concepts with ability to explain definitions, diversification principles,
  and intermarket relationships. However, the mastery criteria requires demonstrating
  application in a *concrete trading scenario*, which is not fully met. The ''Trading
  implications'' section lists actionable strategies (carry trades, multi-currency
  hedging, REIT usage) but lacks a specific, worked-through example with position
  sizing, entry/exit criteria, or outcome analysis. The agent shows awareness of edge
  cases and failure modes (extensive risk factors list, inflation hedge limitations
  for commodities/gold), earning the +0.05 reward. However, there''s a notable tension:
  sources emphasize forex as leading indicator and multi-currency inflation hedge,
  yet also warn commodities/gold are ''poor long-term inflation hedges''—this creates
  an unresolved contradiction about how to actually hedge inflation (-0.05). No multiple
  independent source types are explicitly cited (-0.0). The content stays at strategic
  principle level rather than concrete scenario application (-0.1 for criteria not
  demonstrably met). Starting from 0.5 (can explain), +0.05 for edge cases, -0.05
  for contradiction, -0.1 for missing concrete scenario = 0.55.'

The documents cover asset class definitions, diversification principles, and intermarket analysis as tools for portfolio construction and trading. Key themes include the necessity of multi-currency exposure to hedge against government-induced inflation, the classification of investments into traditional and alternative asset classes, and the use of mathematical intermarket correlations to develop trading systems. Sources emphasize that forex markets provide early warning signals for other markets and that proper asset class diversification requires understanding correlation structures and risk factors unique to each category.

**Key concepts:** Asset class, Currency diversification, Intermarket analysis, Carry trade, Fixed income, Alternative investments, Correlation, Inflation hedge, Risk-adjusted returns, REITs, Derivatives, Hedge funds, Emerging vs developed markets, Duration, Credit quality

**Trading implications:**
- Maintain multi-currency exposure to hedge against government debt monetization through inflation
- Use intermarket correlations to forecast equity and index price movements
- Implement carry trades in stable, long-term forex trends for income generation
- Diversify across uncorrelated asset classes to reduce portfolio volatility
- Consider longer-term holding periods with specific risk-reduction instruments in forex
- Monitor forex markets as leading indicators for changes in other asset classes
- Use REITs as liquid proxy for property exposure despite equity-like correlation contamination

**Risk factors:**
- Currency depreciation from government inflation policies
- Interest rate risk in fixed income (duration sensitivity)
- Credit risk in corporate vs government bonds
- Equity sentiment contamination in REIT-based property exposure
- Poor long-term inflation hedge from commodities and gold
- Illiquidity in alternative investments
- Regulatory changes affecting hedge fund representation
- Emerging market volatility
- Derivatives counterparty risk
- Real estate unpredictability from city planning and socio-political factors
