mastery_reasoning: The agent demonstrates solid foundational understanding of Forward
  P/E, including its definition, comparison to trailing P/E, and basic interpretation
  (lower forward vs. trailing = expected growth, higher = expected decline). The evidence
  quality is strong with multiple high-confidence citations (0.85-0.95). However,
  the mastery criteria requires demonstration in a 'concrete trading scenario,' which
  is not met. While the agent lists general 'trading implications' (use forward P/E
  for high-growth companies), there is no specific, worked-through example of applying
  Forward P/E in an actual trade decision with entry/exit points, position sizing,
  or risk management. The content remains at the level of general principles rather
  than practical application. The agent does identify key risk factors (estimate manipulation,
  cross-industry incompatibility), earning the edge case reward, and cites multiple
  source types (book + web). No major contradictions or unsupported claims detected.

## 2026-02-26 — Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 2

The documents synthesize fundamental valuation metrics (P/E ratios in trailing, forward, absolute, and relative forms) with technical analysis methodologies rooted in Dow Theory. Key themes include using P/E ratios for relative valuation and trend analysis for market timing, while acknowledging limitations of each approach and their complementary applications in trading decisions.

**Key concepts:** Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, Trailing P/E (TTM/LTM), Forward P/E, Earnings Per Share (EPS), PEG Ratio, Earnings Yield, Absolute P/E, Relative P/E, Dow Theory, Trend Analysis, Support and Resistance, Market Breadth, Advance-Decline Line, Sentiment Analysis, Contrary Opinion, Market Efficiency Hypothesis, Behavioral Finance

**Trading implications:**
- Use trailing P/E for mature, stable companies with consistent earnings history; forward P/E for high-growth companies where future earnings better reflect value
- Forward P/E lower than trailing P/E suggests expected earnings growth; higher forward P/E suggests expected earnings decline
- P/E ratios are most valuable for same-industry comparisons, not cross-sector analysis
- Trend identification through Dow Theory principles (primary, secondary, minor trends) with volume confirmation
- Market breadth indicators (advance-decline line, volume ratios) can signal market strength or weakness before price indices
- Contrary sentiment indicators may identify market extremes when uninformed players are heavily positioned one direction
- Combine fundamental valuation with technical timing for entry/exit decisions

**Risk factors:**
- Trailing P/E becomes meaningless for unprofitable companies (no P/E or N/A)
- Forward P/E relies on estimates that may be manipulated by companies or diverge across analysts
- P/E ratios are not comparable across different industries due to varying growth rates and capital structures
- Debt levels can skew P/E comparisons between otherwise similar companies
- Trailing P/E uses fixed historical EPS while stock prices change continuously, creating lag in valuation picture
- Technical analysis assumes trends continue but past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Sentiment indicators can remain extreme for extended periods before reversing
- Market manipulation of earnings data possible since source is company itself

**Evidence trail:**
- [0.9] Trailing P/E is the most commonly used and popular P/E metric because it is thought to be objective *(source: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples)*
- [0.95] Companies with no earnings or negative earnings don't have a P/E ratio because there's nothing to put in the denominator *(source: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples)*
- [0.85] If forward P/E > trailing P/E, analysts expect earnings to decline *(source: Forward P/E vs. Trailing P/E: Key Differences)*
- [0.85] If forward P/E < trailing P/E, analysts expect earnings to increase *(source: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples)*
- [0.9] P/E ratios are most valuable when comparing similar companies in the same industry *(source: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples)*
- [0.9] Dow Theory identifies three trends: primary, secondary, and minor *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 2)*
- [0.85] Volume is important for confirming trend direction in Dow Theory *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 2)*
- [0.9] The concept of confirmation is central to Dow Theory *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 2)*
- [0.8] Crowd behavior and contrary opinion can be used to identify market extremes *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 2)*
- [0.75] Traditional advance-decline methods are no longer profitable *(source: Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 2)*

**Unresolved conflicts:**
- ⚠️ If forward P/E is lower than trailing P/E, analysts expect earnings to increase; if higher, analysts expect them to decline ↔ Companies with no earnings or negative earnings don't have a P/E ratio
