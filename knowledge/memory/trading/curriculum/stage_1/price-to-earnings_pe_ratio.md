mastery_reasoning: 'The agent demonstrates basic awareness of P/E ratio concepts (0.3
  baseline) plus partial explanatory ability. Evidence shows understanding of: P/E
  definition, trailing vs. forward variants, EPS relationship, relative valuation
  use, and key risk factors (negative earnings, cross-industry limitations, leverage
  effects, data lag). However, mastery criteria fails: no concrete trading scenario
  is presented. The content lists ''trading implications'' abstractly without walking
  through an actual example (e.g., ''When comparing two semiconductor stocks, Stock
  A trades at 15x trailing P/E vs. Stock B at 25x...''). No source diversity is shown
  (single markdown file, no books/arXiv/web citations explicitly noted). Edge cases
  are partially identified but not systematically. Confidence levels are not stated
  anywhere, creating implicit unsupported assertions throughout.'

The documents cover fundamental valuation metrics, specifically the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, and technical analysis methodologies. P/E ratios compare stock prices to earnings for valuation assessment, with variations including trailing, forward, absolute, and relative forms. Technical analysis studies price/volume patterns to forecast trends, with foundations in Dow Theory and tools including trend identification, support/resistance levels, and market sentiment indicators.

**Key concepts:** Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, Trailing P/E, Forward P/E, Earnings Per Share (EPS), PEG Ratio, Earnings Yield, Technical Analysis, Trend Analysis, Dow Theory, Support and Resistance, Market Breadth, Sentiment Analysis, Absolute P/E, Relative P/E

**Trading implications:**
- Use P/E ratios for relative valuation within same-industry comparisons
- Forward P/E lower than trailing P/E suggests expected earnings growth
- P/E ratios should be combined with other metrics like PEG for growth-adjusted valuation
- Technical trend identification through price patterns and volume analysis can inform entry/exit timing
- Market breadth indicators and sentiment measures provide contrarian signals for market timing

**Risk factors:**
- P/E ratios cannot be calculated for companies with zero or negative earnings
- Cross-industry P/E comparisons are unreliable due to sector-specific valuation differences
- Company debt levels can distort P/E ratios through leverage effects
- Earnings data may be subject to manipulation or accounting adjustments
- Trailing P/E may not reflect current market conditions due to lagging earnings data
- Forward P/E relies on estimates that may be inaccurate or biased
