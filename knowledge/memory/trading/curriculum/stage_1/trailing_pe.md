mastery_reasoning: 'The agent demonstrates basic awareness of Trailing P/E with some
  ability to explain the concept (0.5 baseline), but falls short of practical application.
  Evidence quality is limited: only one source cited (technical analysis textbook,
  not a dedicated fundamental analysis resource), and the coverage of Trailing P/E
  is brief/secondary to the main technical analysis focus. The agent correctly distinguishes
  trailing vs. forward P/E, notes appropriate use cases (mature companies), and identifies
  key risk factors (past earnings may not predict future, non-recurring items, valuation
  lag). However, the mastery criteria requires ''concrete trading scenario'' application,
  which is absent—only generic trading implications are listed without a worked example.
  The agent shows awareness of edge cases (unprofitable companies, non-recurring items)
  but doesn''t demonstrate nuanced application. No multiple independent source types
  (+0.05 not applied). No unresolved contradictions. The content meets explanatory
  threshold but not practical application threshold, warranting -0.1 penalty for unmet
  mastery criteria, and -0.05 for lack of concrete scenario.'

## 2026-02-25 — Technical Analysis - The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians 2nd edition 2010 — part 3

The documents cover fundamental valuation using P/E ratios (trailing vs. forward) and technical analysis methodologies including trend identification, support/resistance, and breakouts. Trailing P/E is the most commonly used valuation metric based on historical earnings, while technical analysis relies on price patterns and Dow Theory principles for trading decisions.

**Key concepts:** Trailing P/E Ratio, Forward P/E Ratio, Earnings Per Share (EPS), LTM/TTM Earnings, Technical Analysis, Dow Theory, Support and Resistance, Trend Analysis, Breakouts, Point-and-Figure Charts, Market Efficiency, Behavioral Finance

**Trading implications:**
- Use trailing P/E for mature, low-growth companies with stable earnings history
- Forward P/E may be more appropriate for high-growth companies where future earnings better reflect value
- Trailing P/E becomes meaningless for unprofitable companies; use forward multiples instead
- Identify trend direction through peaks and troughs analysis for entry/exit timing
- Use support/resistance levels to determine stop placement and position sizing
- Confirm breakouts with volume and closing prices beyond key levels before entering positions
- Compare P/E ratios within same industry for relative valuation assessment

**Risk factors:**
- Trailing P/E relies on past earnings that may not predict future performance
- Non-recurring items can distort trailing P/E calculations
- Forward P/E depends on analyst estimates prone to bias and error
- Companies may manipulate earnings to beat consensus estimates
- Stock prices move constantly while trailing earnings remain fixed, creating valuation lag
- False breakouts ('specialist breakouts') can trigger premature entries
- Support/resistance levels may fail during high volatility or news events
- Technical patterns assume market inefficiency, contradicting EMH assumptions
