small investor. This was a tenet throughout this life, and unlike Charles Dow, Wyckoff was a prolific writer and publisher. His seminal work, The Richard Wyckoff Method of Trading and Investing in Stocks, first published in the early 1930’s, as a correspondence course, remains the blueprint which all Wall Street investment banks still use today. It is essentially a course of instruction, and although hard to find, is still available in a hard copy version from vintage booksellers. Throughout his life, Wyckoff was always keen to ensure that the self directed investor was given an insight into how the markets actually worked, and in 1907 launched a hugely successful monthly magazine called The Ticker, later merged into The Magazine of Wall Street, which became even more popular. One of the many reasons for this was his view of the market and market behaviour. First, he firmly believed that to be successful you needed to do you own technical analysis, and ignore the views o

CHAPTER 1 THE ROAD TO SUCCESS: FUNDAMENTAL, TECHNICAL, OR MENTAL ANALYSIS? IN THE BEGINNING: FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS Who remembers when fundamental analysis was considered the only real or proper way to make trading decisions? When I started trading in 1978, technical analysis was used by only a handful of traders, who were considered by the rest of the market community to be, at the very least, crazy. As difficult as it is to believe now, it wasn't very long ago when Wall Street and most of the major funds and financial institutions thought that technical analysis was some form of mystical hocus-pocus. Now, of course, just the opposite is true. Almost all experienced traders use some form of technical analysis to help them formulate their trading strategies. Except for some small, isolated pockets in the academic community, the "purely" fundamental analyst is virtually extinct. What caused this dramatic shift in perspective? I'm sure it's no surprise to anyone that the ans

Part 1 Introduction are influenced by psychological factors as well, most of them indecipherable. Greed, fear, cognitive bias, misinformation, expectations, and other factors enter into the price of a security, making the analysis of the factors nearly impossible. The technical analyst, thus, disregards all these imponderables and studies how the marketplace is accepting the multitude of exogenous information and beliefs with the intention of finding secrets in that action that have predictive potential. Students new to any discipline often ask, “How can I use the knowledge of this discipline?” Students new to technical analysis are no different. Technical analysis is used in two major ways: predictive and reactive. Those who use technical analysis for predictive purposes use the analysis to make predictions about future market moves. Generally, these individuals make money by selling their predictions to others. Market letter writers in print or on the Web and the techn

Support levels are usually below the current price, but it is not uncommon for a security to trade at or near support . As technical analysis is not an exact science, setting precise support levels can often be difficult. In addition, price movements can be volatile and briefly dip below support . For example, it does not seem logical to consider a support level broken if the price closes an ...

Support and resistance are fundamental aspects of technical analysis - occurring in almost every market, including stocks, commodities, and forex - that could assist traders in interpreting potential price movements. Prices change due to the dynamics of supply and demand; when demand outweighs supply, prices tend to increase.

In finance, technical analysis is an analysis methodology for analysing and forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. As a type of active management, it stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of technical analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable, and research on whether technical analysis offers any benefit has produced mixed results. It is distinguished from fundamental analysis, which considers a company's financial statements, health, and the overall state of the market and economy.

any stock at a PIE of 10 or less could be purchased. One of the key things I look at is the 10 PIE ratio level on a chart. If you see a PIE ratio of 10, normally you see technical support in that particular stock. Other variations that may be used are stocks at a PIE level of to or less as well as Cash to Short Term CST) Liability's level of50 percent. This would indicate the stock is trading at a low eamings multiple. The stock is well funded in temlS of its debt exposure, All of this obviously has nothing to do with technicals or charting-it's financial company analysis. But when overlying these stocks onto a chart you may be able to apply support levels to this fundamental analysis. Today, if you listen to the news, you will see that many companies pro­ vide many revisions to their numbers and also many companies are "cook­ ing the books." They manipulate numbers before earnings aIlIlOWlcements just to drive the stock price higher. Based on these manipulated values, f

authors and their timely book which has sold some 800,000 plus copies and in later years has earned for itself the accolade of “the bible of Technical Analysis.” A check with most dedicated technical analysts who have learned their craft since 1948 would confirm their personal debt to this work, which was responsible for introducing them to Technical Analysis or expanding their technical education. But how did all of this come about? Technical Analysis certainly did not have a long history of acceptance in the 1940s and before by the established investment fraternity in New York, London, Paris and elsewhere. Without a doubt it was easier to keep to long held beliefs that this form of analysis, utilizing charts of share price action, was more akin to mumbo-jumbo than to the accepted seemingly logical approach built around the respectable tools of Fundamental Analysis. To value a company it was enough to analyze its accounts, work out its p/e ratio, be aware of its researc

Academy Center &gt; Analysis Analysis Beginner Price-to-Earnings Ratio – P/E Ratio Definition, Formula and Examples written by Dan Blystone expertise: Futures | Forex | Technical Analysis currently: Market Analyst, TradersLog.com education: College of Wooster See Full Bio | updated February 11, 2025 The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is among the most important and commonly used valuation metrics in the fundamental analysis of stocks. It is also referred to as the price multiple, or the earnings multiple. Benjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing and the mentor of Warren Buffett, helped to popularize the P/E ratio. In this article, we’ll explain the meaning of P/E ratio and how it can help guide your investment decisions. What is Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)? Copied Copy To Clipboard The P/E ratio compares a stock’s price to its earnings. By showing the relationship between a company&#8217;s stock price and earnings per share (EPS), the P/E ratio helps investors to value a stock and gauge market expectations. The average market P/E ratio is 20-25 times earnings.&nbsp; Investor Expectations Copied Copy To Clipboard Stocks with high P/E ratios may suggest that investors are expecting higher earnings growth in the future. While stocks with high P/E ratios are attractive to growth investors, stocks with low P/E ratios are appealing to value investors because it means they are paying less for every dollar of earnings they receive.&nbsp; Why Use the Price-to-Earnings Ratio? Copied Copy To Clipboard The P/E ratio gives investors insight into whether a stock may be overvalued, appropriately priced, or undervalued and is a useful means of comparing stocks, especially within the same industry. P/E ratios can be applied to both stocks and stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq 100 . How to Calculate P/E Ratio?

Chapter 11, if it is difficult to short the market, then a basic premise of the efficient markets theory is not met. The so-called “smart money” can stop investing in homes altogether, but afterward will not be able to take actions to stop others from bidding prices even further up and up. Any large group of investors, from anywhere in the world, for example, could bid local home prices up to crazy levels if they get the idea to do so, or any large institutional investors, playing some kind of game, could do so too. There is no reputable theory to say that, in the absence of the possibility of short sales, they cannot. Many have tried to make such short sales for single-family homes possible, so far with little success. In the past few years, some high-tech institutional players, such as the Blackstone Group, have begun to invest in single-family homes, and the presence of these players might tend to alter the dynamics of home price bubbles, reducing month-to-month momen

. Investors have operated within a fixed schedule, trading primarily between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday. However, that tradition may soon shift dramatically. Nasdaq plans to introduce 24-hour trading in late-2026, allowing equities to be bought and sold at any time of day or night. If successful, this change could fundamentally alter how global markets operate and how investors engage with them.&lt;/p>\n&lt;h2>Current System vs. 24-Hour Trading&lt;/h2>\n&lt;p>Currently, U.S. equity markets offer limited after-hours and pre-market trading sessions outside regular hours. These sessions allow some trading flexibility but are often characterized by lower liquidity, higher volatility, and wider spreads. They are primarily used by institutional investors, while retail participation remains limited.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The proposed round-the-clock trading system would vastly expand access, extending trading hours for 24/5, 24 hours a day, Monday through Friday. This would represent a major shift from today’s segmented structure to a continuous, global model, similar to cryptocurrency markets. Nasdaq’s move toward 24-hour trading follows in the footsteps of both the New York Stock Exchange and Cboe, which have already announced extended trading hours to better accommodate global demand. These earlier initiatives signal a broader industry shift toward making U.S. equity markets more accessible to international investors, especially those in the Asia-Pacific region who want to trade during their daytime hours.&lt;/p>\n&lt;h2>Why 24-Hour Trading?&lt;/h2>\n&lt;p>There are several motivations behind Nasdaq’s push. The primary advantage of 24-hour trading is increased flexibility for investors. Retail and institutional investors alike could react to news events, earnings reports, or geopolitical developments without having to wait for the market to open. This could improve risk management and allow for more dynamic portfolio adjustments.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Ad

Chapter 2), but in a nutshell, in 1990 the U.K. decided to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System in order to take part in the low-inflationary yet stable economy generated by the Germany’s central bank, which is also known as the Bundesbank. This alliance tied the pound to the deutsche mark, which meant that the U.K. was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the Bundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to avoid the inflationary effects related to German reunification. However, national pride and the commitment of fixing exchange rates within the ERM prevented the U.K. from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, 1992, also known as Black Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and sold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the Exchange Rate Mechanism. This essentially “broke” the Bank of England and forced the devaluation of its currency. In a matter of 24 hours, the British pound fell approximately 5 percent or 5,000 pips. The Bank of England promised to raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, the bond markets also experienced tremendous volatility, with the one-month U.K. London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) increasing 1 percent and then retracing the gain over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were completely oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they probably would have found themselves dumbstruck in the face of such a rapid gyration in yields. 5 Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds For U.S. government bond traders, there has also been a brewing issue that has made it imperative to learn to monitor the developments in the currency markets. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of speculation about the possible revaluation of the Chinese yuan. Despite strong economic growth and a trade surplus with many countries, China has artificially maintained its currency within a tight trading

Part 2 we will examine how these findings hold up on a more continuous basis. In­ cluded within is a series of six months of consecutive 5-minute sessions of the eur / usd. Besides providing a massive amount of study material, this series should leave little doubt behind as to the amazing continuity and exploitability of price action themes from one session to the next. One of the most common questions I rec.eived in response to my first book, Forex Price Action Scalping, was if the principles and setups pointed out on a fast scalping chart (70-tick) could also be applied to the higher intraday frames, like the 2 or 5-minute, or even the hourly for that matter. There can only be one answer to this question: price action principles are transposable to any time frame of choice because they bear within them the universal laws of supply and demand. This is not bounded by the time in which it takes place, nor is it a prerogative of any one market. From one instrument or time

Chapter 4. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this information to assess current and future performance. This requires a great deal of work and thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental analysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast of news and announcements that can indicate potential changes to the economic, social, and political environment. All traders should have some awareness of the broad economic conditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who are trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is already completely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EUR/USD, say, could be nominal. Taking a step back, currency prices move primarily based on supply and demand. That is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand for that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative, or conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency. Currency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be the real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to 29 predict supply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors that contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency, such as capital flows, trade flows, speculative needs, and hedging needs. For example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) from 1999 to the end of 2001, a situation primarily driven by the U.S. Internet and equity market boom and the desire for foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand for U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase U.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, when geopolitical uncertainty rose, the United States started cutting interest
