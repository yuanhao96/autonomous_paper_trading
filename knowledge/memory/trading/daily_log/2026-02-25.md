small investor. This was a tenet throughout this life, and unlike Charles Dow, Wyckoff was a prolific writer and publisher. His seminal work, The Richard Wyckoff Method of Trading and Investing in Stocks, first published in the early 1930’s, as a correspondence course, remains the blueprint which all Wall Street investment banks still use today. It is essentially a course of instruction, and although hard to find, is still available in a hard copy version from vintage booksellers. Throughout his life, Wyckoff was always keen to ensure that the self directed investor was given an insight into how the markets actually worked, and in 1907 launched a hugely successful monthly magazine called The Ticker, later merged into The Magazine of Wall Street, which became even more popular. One of the many reasons for this was his view of the market and market behaviour. First, he firmly believed that to be successful you needed to do you own technical analysis, and ignore the views o

CHAPTER 1 THE ROAD TO SUCCESS: FUNDAMENTAL, TECHNICAL, OR MENTAL ANALYSIS? IN THE BEGINNING: FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS Who remembers when fundamental analysis was considered the only real or proper way to make trading decisions? When I started trading in 1978, technical analysis was used by only a handful of traders, who were considered by the rest of the market community to be, at the very least, crazy. As difficult as it is to believe now, it wasn't very long ago when Wall Street and most of the major funds and financial institutions thought that technical analysis was some form of mystical hocus-pocus. Now, of course, just the opposite is true. Almost all experienced traders use some form of technical analysis to help them formulate their trading strategies. Except for some small, isolated pockets in the academic community, the "purely" fundamental analyst is virtually extinct. What caused this dramatic shift in perspective? I'm sure it's no surprise to anyone that the ans

Part 1 Introduction are influenced by psychological factors as well, most of them indecipherable. Greed, fear, cognitive bias, misinformation, expectations, and other factors enter into the price of a security, making the analysis of the factors nearly impossible. The technical analyst, thus, disregards all these imponderables and studies how the marketplace is accepting the multitude of exogenous information and beliefs with the intention of finding secrets in that action that have predictive potential. Students new to any discipline often ask, “How can I use the knowledge of this discipline?” Students new to technical analysis are no different. Technical analysis is used in two major ways: predictive and reactive. Those who use technical analysis for predictive purposes use the analysis to make predictions about future market moves. Generally, these individuals make money by selling their predictions to others. Market letter writers in print or on the Web and the techn

Support levels are usually below the current price, but it is not uncommon for a security to trade at or near support . As technical analysis is not an exact science, setting precise support levels can often be difficult. In addition, price movements can be volatile and briefly dip below support . For example, it does not seem logical to consider a support level broken if the price closes an ...

Support and resistance are fundamental aspects of technical analysis - occurring in almost every market, including stocks, commodities, and forex - that could assist traders in interpreting potential price movements. Prices change due to the dynamics of supply and demand; when demand outweighs supply, prices tend to increase.

In finance, technical analysis is an analysis methodology for analysing and forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. As a type of active management, it stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of technical analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable, and research on whether technical analysis offers any benefit has produced mixed results. It is distinguished from fundamental analysis, which considers a company's financial statements, health, and the overall state of the market and economy.

any stock at a PIE of 10 or less could be purchased. One of the key things I look at is the 10 PIE ratio level on a chart. If you see a PIE ratio of 10, normally you see technical support in that particular stock. Other variations that may be used are stocks at a PIE level of to or less as well as Cash to Short Term CST) Liability's level of50 percent. This would indicate the stock is trading at a low eamings multiple. The stock is well funded in temlS of its debt exposure, All of this obviously has nothing to do with technicals or charting-it's financial company analysis. But when overlying these stocks onto a chart you may be able to apply support levels to this fundamental analysis. Today, if you listen to the news, you will see that many companies pro­ vide many revisions to their numbers and also many companies are "cook­ ing the books." They manipulate numbers before earnings aIlIlOWlcements just to drive the stock price higher. Based on these manipulated values, f

authors and their timely book which has sold some 800,000 plus copies and in later years has earned for itself the accolade of “the bible of Technical Analysis.” A check with most dedicated technical analysts who have learned their craft since 1948 would confirm their personal debt to this work, which was responsible for introducing them to Technical Analysis or expanding their technical education. But how did all of this come about? Technical Analysis certainly did not have a long history of acceptance in the 1940s and before by the established investment fraternity in New York, London, Paris and elsewhere. Without a doubt it was easier to keep to long held beliefs that this form of analysis, utilizing charts of share price action, was more akin to mumbo-jumbo than to the accepted seemingly logical approach built around the respectable tools of Fundamental Analysis. To value a company it was enough to analyze its accounts, work out its p/e ratio, be aware of its researc

Academy Center &gt; Analysis Analysis Beginner Price-to-Earnings Ratio – P/E Ratio Definition, Formula and Examples written by Dan Blystone expertise: Futures | Forex | Technical Analysis currently: Market Analyst, TradersLog.com education: College of Wooster See Full Bio | updated February 11, 2025 The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is among the most important and commonly used valuation metrics in the fundamental analysis of stocks. It is also referred to as the price multiple, or the earnings multiple. Benjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing and the mentor of Warren Buffett, helped to popularize the P/E ratio. In this article, we’ll explain the meaning of P/E ratio and how it can help guide your investment decisions. What is Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)? Copied Copy To Clipboard The P/E ratio compares a stock’s price to its earnings. By showing the relationship between a company&#8217;s stock price and earnings per share (EPS), the P/E ratio helps investors to value a stock and gauge market expectations. The average market P/E ratio is 20-25 times earnings.&nbsp; Investor Expectations Copied Copy To Clipboard Stocks with high P/E ratios may suggest that investors are expecting higher earnings growth in the future. While stocks with high P/E ratios are attractive to growth investors, stocks with low P/E ratios are appealing to value investors because it means they are paying less for every dollar of earnings they receive.&nbsp; Why Use the Price-to-Earnings Ratio? Copied Copy To Clipboard The P/E ratio gives investors insight into whether a stock may be overvalued, appropriately priced, or undervalued and is a useful means of comparing stocks, especially within the same industry. P/E ratios can be applied to both stocks and stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq 100 . How to Calculate P/E Ratio?

Chapter 11, if it is difficult to short the market, then a basic premise of the efficient markets theory is not met. The so-called “smart money” can stop investing in homes altogether, but afterward will not be able to take actions to stop others from bidding prices even further up and up. Any large group of investors, from anywhere in the world, for example, could bid local home prices up to crazy levels if they get the idea to do so, or any large institutional investors, playing some kind of game, could do so too. There is no reputable theory to say that, in the absence of the possibility of short sales, they cannot. Many have tried to make such short sales for single-family homes possible, so far with little success. In the past few years, some high-tech institutional players, such as the Blackstone Group, have begun to invest in single-family homes, and the presence of these players might tend to alter the dynamics of home price bubbles, reducing month-to-month momen

. Investors have operated within a fixed schedule, trading primarily between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday. However, that tradition may soon shift dramatically. Nasdaq plans to introduce 24-hour trading in late-2026, allowing equities to be bought and sold at any time of day or night. If successful, this change could fundamentally alter how global markets operate and how investors engage with them.&lt;/p>\n&lt;h2>Current System vs. 24-Hour Trading&lt;/h2>\n&lt;p>Currently, U.S. equity markets offer limited after-hours and pre-market trading sessions outside regular hours. These sessions allow some trading flexibility but are often characterized by lower liquidity, higher volatility, and wider spreads. They are primarily used by institutional investors, while retail participation remains limited.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The proposed round-the-clock trading system would vastly expand access, extending trading hours for 24/5, 24 hours a day, Monday through Friday. This would represent a major shift from today’s segmented structure to a continuous, global model, similar to cryptocurrency markets. Nasdaq’s move toward 24-hour trading follows in the footsteps of both the New York Stock Exchange and Cboe, which have already announced extended trading hours to better accommodate global demand. These earlier initiatives signal a broader industry shift toward making U.S. equity markets more accessible to international investors, especially those in the Asia-Pacific region who want to trade during their daytime hours.&lt;/p>\n&lt;h2>Why 24-Hour Trading?&lt;/h2>\n&lt;p>There are several motivations behind Nasdaq’s push. The primary advantage of 24-hour trading is increased flexibility for investors. Retail and institutional investors alike could react to news events, earnings reports, or geopolitical developments without having to wait for the market to open. This could improve risk management and allow for more dynamic portfolio adjustments.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Ad

Chapter 2), but in a nutshell, in 1990 the U.K. decided to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System in order to take part in the low-inflationary yet stable economy generated by the Germany’s central bank, which is also known as the Bundesbank. This alliance tied the pound to the deutsche mark, which meant that the U.K. was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the Bundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to avoid the inflationary effects related to German reunification. However, national pride and the commitment of fixing exchange rates within the ERM prevented the U.K. from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, 1992, also known as Black Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and sold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the Exchange Rate Mechanism. This essentially “broke” the Bank of England and forced the devaluation of its currency. In a matter of 24 hours, the British pound fell approximately 5 percent or 5,000 pips. The Bank of England promised to raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, the bond markets also experienced tremendous volatility, with the one-month U.K. London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) increasing 1 percent and then retracing the gain over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were completely oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they probably would have found themselves dumbstruck in the face of such a rapid gyration in yields. 5 Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds For U.S. government bond traders, there has also been a brewing issue that has made it imperative to learn to monitor the developments in the currency markets. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of speculation about the possible revaluation of the Chinese yuan. Despite strong economic growth and a trade surplus with many countries, China has artificially maintained its currency within a tight trading

Part 2 we will examine how these findings hold up on a more continuous basis. In­ cluded within is a series of six months of consecutive 5-minute sessions of the eur / usd. Besides providing a massive amount of study material, this series should leave little doubt behind as to the amazing continuity and exploitability of price action themes from one session to the next. One of the most common questions I rec.eived in response to my first book, Forex Price Action Scalping, was if the principles and setups pointed out on a fast scalping chart (70-tick) could also be applied to the higher intraday frames, like the 2 or 5-minute, or even the hourly for that matter. There can only be one answer to this question: price action principles are transposable to any time frame of choice because they bear within them the universal laws of supply and demand. This is not bounded by the time in which it takes place, nor is it a prerogative of any one market. From one instrument or time

Chapter 4. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this information to assess current and future performance. This requires a great deal of work and thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental analysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast of news and announcements that can indicate potential changes to the economic, social, and political environment. All traders should have some awareness of the broad economic conditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who are trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is already completely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EUR/USD, say, could be nominal. Taking a step back, currency prices move primarily based on supply and demand. That is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand for that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative, or conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency. Currency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be the real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to 29 predict supply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors that contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency, such as capital flows, trade flows, speculative needs, and hedging needs. For example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) from 1999 to the end of 2001, a situation primarily driven by the U.S. Internet and equity market boom and the desire for foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand for U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase U.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, when geopolitical uncertainty rose, the United States started cutting interest

CHAPTER 1 Three Must-Know Forex Facts Forex's Top Three Lessons The three most important lessons you'll ever learn about foreign exchange (forex) markets are: 1. Everyone needs forex diversification. Just as every competent investor needs to diversify by asset classes and sectors, so too they need exposure to assets in multiple currencies and an understanding of forex trends and what's driving them.

Even though forex is dominated by short-term, high-risk speculators, there are investing/trading styles suitable for both: 1. More conservative active traders who use longer-term holding periods and specific methods and instruments to reduce risk. 2. Long-term investors who know how to: Ride stable, proven, long-term forex trends for capital gains.

Investopedia / Mira Norian Close Definition Trailing price-to-earnings is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the trailing earnings-per-share for the past 12 months. What Is Trailing Price-to-Earnings? Trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) is a relative valuation multiple that is based on the last 12 months of actual earnings. It is calculated by taking the current stock price and dividing it by the trailing earnings per share (EPS) for the past 12 months. Trailing P/E can be contrasted with the&nbsp; forward P/E , which instead&nbsp;uses projected future earnings to calculate the&nbsp;price-to-earnings ratio.&nbsp; Key Takeaways The trailing price-to-earnings ratio looks at a company&#39;s share price in the market relative to its past year&#39;s earnings per share. Trailing P/E is considered a useful indicator to standardize and compare relative share price between time periods and among companies. Trailing P/E, though widespread in use, is limited in that past earnings may not accurately reflect the current or future earnings situation of the company.

After-Hours Trading Definition After-hours trading refers to the buying and selling of securities outside of the standard trading hours of a stock exchange . "After-hours trading" is the time after the major stock exchanges close, during which some trading still occurs. After-hours trading begins at 4 PM US Eastern Time and can run as late as 8 PM. Transactions can still occur before and after these times, allowing for extended trading opportunities. This trading is conducted through electronic communication networks, or ECNs, rather than traditional stock exchanges, like the NYSE, or New York Stock Exchange . This type of trading can occur due to various reasons, including different time zones or the release of significant news after the market has closed. How Does After-Hours Trading Work? After-hours trading is available for investors to utilize when news breaks after the close of the regular trading session which occurs between 9:30 AM and 4 PM Eastern Time. For example, if a company's earnings report is released after hours, it may prompt investors to buy or sell a stock . Although a spike in volume may occur initially with the release of news, trading volume will usually thin out as the session progresses, often by 6 PM. Extended Hours Sessions While the standard trading hours cater to a significant portion of the market, extended hours sessions accommodate those looking to trade outside these times. There are mainly two sessions: the pre-market session, which happens before the regular market opens, and the post-market session, which occurs after the regular market closes. The exact timing of these sessions can vary depending on the specific stock exchange and the brokerage facilitating the trade. Participants in After-Hours Trading Historically, institutional investors primarily engaged in after-hours trading due to their extensive resources and sophisticated trading technology. However, with the rise of electronic communication networks (ECNs), individual r

Market Hours Unveiled: Discover the Global Trading Session Timetable Explaining Trading Sessions A trading session is a window of time that corresponds with the main trading hours of the day for a particular location. Various hours will be indicated by this term, based on the marketplaces and places under discussion. The trading session that each individual investor or trader will refer to is often one full day of trading in the local financial market, from the opening bell to the closing bell. Table of Contents: Toggle Explaining Trading Sessions What To Keep in Mind Taking a Closer Look at How a Trading Session Really Works Trading Sessions of Pre-Market and After Hours Trading Sessions Around the Clock Frequent Trading Events Worldwide Trading Sessions Futures Market&nbsp; Variable features of the currency,&nbsp; futures , stock, and bond markets define their individual trading sessions on any given day, and varied time zones inevitably result in distinct primary trading hours across different countries. What To Keep in Mind The main trading period and location for a particular asset class are called a trading session. On weekdays, regular trading hours for U.S. stocks are 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET). This is a clearly defined trading session. Futures market trading hours are nearly 24 hours a day, six days a week. However, each product has its own unique futures trading times . Within a 24-hour period, the NYSE&#8217;s operating hours correspond to the peak trading activity. Various markets could have their own working hours, and foreign exchange deals with a lot of overlapping sessions that happen across different time zones around the world. Taking a Closer Look at How a Trading Session Really Works The duration of trading sessions varies by nation and asset class. Monday through Friday, except holidays, the regular trading session for U.S. equities begins at 9:30 a.m. and concludes at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET). The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE

Adding in Germany, France, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 42 percent of total FX trailing.

PART II The World's Biggest Market 12 13 Bill Lipschutz: The Sultan of Currencies Quick, what is the world's largest financial market? Stocks? No, not even if you aggregate all the world's equity markets. Of course, it must be bonds. Just think of the huge government debt that has been generated worldwide. Good guess, but wrong again, even if you combine all the world's fixed-income markets. The correct answer is currencies. In the scope of all financial trading, stocks and bonds are peanuts compared with currencies. It is estimated that, on average, $1 trillion is traded each day in the world currency markets. The vast majority of this currency trading does not take place on any organized exchange but rather is transacted in the interbank currency market. The interbank currency market is a twenty-four-hour market, which literally follows the sun around the world, moving from banking centers of the United States, to Australia, to the Far East, to Europe, and finally back

The documents synthesize global market hours and extended trading mechanics across forex and equity markets, emphasizing that session overlaps (particularly London-New York) generate peak volatility and liquidity, while after-hours trading through ECNs offers flexibility but carries significant risks including thin liquidity, wide spreads, and limited order types. The forex market operates nearly 24/5 with continuous interbank trading, whereas equity extended hours (4-8 PM and 4-9:30 AM ET) are characterized by lower participation and heightened price volatility.

Key themes include: the three major forex sessions (Tokyo, London, New York) with their distinct characteristics; the importance of session overlaps for volatility and liquidity; after-hours trading mechanics in equities with associated risks; and upcoming structural changes like Nasdaq's planned 24-hour trading. Price action principles based on supply and demand are time-frame independent, while liquidity patterns differ substantially between regular and extended hours.

Chapter 1 | Historical Background Market Structure In its modern form, the forex market closely resembles many of the other financial markets, with a few critical exceptions. Unlike the markets for other securities, forex trading is geographically decentralized. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the United Kingdom, United States, and Japan are the three largest trading centers, followed by Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, France, Denmark and Germany. Together, these ten countries account for more than 90% of forex volume. Ironically, the rise in electronic trading (which would seem to render geography irrelevant) has spurred the creation of tight trading clusters. This has caused volume to become ever more concentrated in a handful of cities, namely London and New York City (Figure 1-2). Figure 1-2. Geographical distribution of forex trading While countries should enjoy a natural monopoly (or a comparative advantage) in the exchange

Forex markets provide currency diversification and potential for risk-adjusted returns, with governments using inflation to reduce debt burdens making multi-currency exposure essential. Asset classes group investments with similar characteristics and market behaviors, with diversification across uncorrelated classes reducing portfolio risk. Intermarket analysis reveals correlations between markets that can be exploited for trading advantages, while fixed income securities offer predictable income streams but face inflation and interest rate risks.

CHAPTER 1 Three Must-Know Forex Facts Forex's Top Three Lessons The three most important lessons you'll ever learn about foreign exchange (forex) markets are: 1. Everyone needs forex diversification. Just as every competent investor needs to diversify by asset classes and sectors, so too they need exposure to assets in multiple currencies and an understanding of forex trends and what's driving them. Yet most have almost all their assets denominated in one or two currencies. Today, that is an especially fatal error, because the governments behind most major currencies intend to get out of debt by causing inflation, which allows them to repay their bonds with depreciated money. That's good for those governments, and disastrous for those holding their weakened currency and anything denominated in it. They won't admit it, but historically low interest rates and a steady stream of economic stimulus programs betray their real intentions. They want to reduce their real debt, an

Chapter 2, the right currency investments can provide long-term appreciation as well as steady income yields. FACT 2: POTENTIAL FOR BETTER RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS There are more reasons to have forex exposure beyond currency diversification. Once you do some homework, you'll realize that forex is arguably among the most rewarding asset classes for traders and investors. Even though forex is dominated by short-term, high-risk speculators, there are investing/trading styles suitable for both: 1. More conservative active traders who use longer-term holding periods and specific methods and instruments to reduce risk. 2. Long-term investors who know how to: Ride stable, proven, long-term forex trends for capital gains. Earn steady income from “carry trades” or from investing in bonds, dividend stocks, and other income vehicles denominated in the right currencies.

Asset Class Descriptions In deciding upon the suitable set of asset classes, we followed the below criteria. They must: Cover the vast majority of liquid asset types found in investment portfolios/funds to be mapped; Distinguish between unique types of assets (i.e. "Equity" may be considered too broad, and thereby lump together sub-asset-classes with very different characteristics, whilst "UK Small Cap Utilities" may be considered too specific); Be usable in projecting long term return paths. There must be representative indices available, with monthly returns data stretching back as far as the risk engine requires. Exhaust the additional benefit from including further granularity into the asset class set Asset Classes Cash As the "risk-free" asset, cash is not split into any sub-components. It should consist solely of liquid, high credit&nbsp; quality, very low duration assets such as bank deposits, money market funds, etc. Fixed Income There are two major factors affecting prices: interest rates (duration of the bond), and credit quality. Duration can be seen as roughly analogous to equity beta, in the sense that longer duration bonds are more responsive to changes in interest rates. Credit quality offers another source of potential return through the additional yield on offer to compensate for the extra risk. Typically, investment funds/portfolios are not broken down by duration, but by credit quality. It therefore makes sense to split Fixed Income by credit quality first and foremost: into Investment Grade and High Yield. Within the Investment Grade section, it makes sense to further split between Government- and Corporate-issued debt. This is because sovereign bonds are considered considerably less risky than their corporate cousins; only central banks have the power to print money to avoid default, albeit at the cost of inflation. Thus, government bonds are usually perceived as offering only interest rate risk, with de minimis credit risk. When considering eme

4 mins 06-Janurary-2026 An asset class is a category of investments that share similar characteristics and are governed by the same rules and regulations. It must be noted that within an asset class, the individual investments perform in a comparable manner in the financial markets. For example, stocks (equities), bonds (fixed income), commodities (like gold and oil), and real estate are all different asset classes. Each of these groups has its own characteristics and behaves in distinct ways. Investors must understand these asset classes to smartly diversify their portfolios. Also, such an understanding helps in managing risks, as different asset classes often respond differently to economic changes. Let’s understand the different types of mutual funds based on asset classes in detail and learn what are alternative asset classes. We will also study the various additional factors primarily used for classifying assets. What is an asset class? Asset classes meaning: Asset classes are broad categories of investments that share similar characteristics, risk profiles, and return patterns. In simple terms, asset classes group investments based on how they behave in the market and how they respond to economic changes. Common asset classes include equities (stocks), debt instruments (bonds), real estate, commodities like gold, and cash or cash equivalents. Each asset class reacts differently to market conditions such as inflation, interest rate changes, or economic growth. Understanding asset classes helps investors build diversified portfolios, manage risk effectively, and align investments with financial goals. By spreading investments across multiple asset classes, investors can reduce volatility and improve long-term return potential. Types of asset classes Asset classes are groups of investments with similar traits and behaviours. It must be noted that they can be classified using several criteria. For example, consumption assets like oil or investment assets can be ca
