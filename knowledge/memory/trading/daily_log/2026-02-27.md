CHAPTER 1 Three Must-Know Forex Facts Forex's Top Three Lessons The three most important lessons you'll ever learn about foreign exchange (forex) markets are: 1. Everyone needs forex diversification. Just as every competent investor needs to diversify by asset classes and sectors, so too they need exposure to assets in multiple currencies and an understanding of forex trends and what's driving them. Yet most have almost all their assets denominated in one or two currencies. Today, that is an especially fatal error, because the governments behind most major currencies intend to get out of debt by causing inflation, which allows them to repay their bonds with depreciated money. That's good for those governments, and disastrous for those holding their weakened currency and anything denominated in it. They won't admit it, but historically low interest rates and a steady stream of economic stimulus programs betray their real intentions. They want to reduce their real debt, an

Forex markets provide currency diversification and potential for risk-adjusted returns, with governments using inflation to reduce debt burdens making multi-currency exposure essential. Asset classes group investments with similar characteristics and market behaviors, with diversification across uncorrelated classes reducing portfolio risk. Intermarket analysis reveals correlations between markets that can be exploited for trading advantages, while fixed income securities offer predictable income streams but face inflation and interest rate risks.

Multiple sources emphasize currency diversification as essential protection against government-induced inflation and debt devaluation strategies. Forex markets offer early warning signals for other markets, with three major trading sessions (Tokyo, London, New York) providing varying liquidity and volatility. Foreign exchange risk manifests as transaction, translation, and economic risk, requiring hedging strategies like forward contracts and options. Asset class diversification across uncorrelated instruments, including forex carry trades and multi-currency exposure, improves risk-adjusted returns.

Chapter 2, the right currency investments can provide long-term appreciation as well as steady income yields. FACT 2: POTENTIAL FOR BETTER RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS There are more reasons to have forex exposure beyond currency diversification. Once you do some homework, you'll realize that forex is arguably among the most rewarding asset classes for traders and investors. Even though forex is dominated by short-term, high-risk speculators, there are investing/trading styles suitable for both: 1.
