CHAPTER 1 Three Must-Know Forex Facts Forex's Top Three Lessons The three most important lessons you'll ever learn about foreign exchange (forex) markets are: 1. Everyone needs forex diversification. Just as every competent investor needs to diversify by asset classes and sectors, so too they need exposure to assets in multiple currencies and an understanding of forex trends and what's driving them. Yet most have almost all their assets denominated in one or two currencies. Today, that is an especially fatal error, because the governments behind most major currencies intend to get out of debt by causing inflation, which allows them to repay their bonds with depreciated money. That's good for those governments, and disastrous for those holding their weakened currency and anything denominated in it. They won't admit it, but historically low interest rates and a steady stream of economic stimulus programs betray their real intentions. They want to reduce their real debt, an

The documents cover asset class definitions, diversification principles, and intermarket analysis as tools for portfolio construction and trading. Key themes include the necessity of multi-currency exposure to hedge against government-induced inflation, the classification of investments into traditional and alternative asset classes, and the use of mathematical intermarket correlations to develop trading systems. Sources emphasize that forex markets provide early warning signals for other markets and that proper asset class diversification requires understanding correlation structures and risk factors unique to each category.

Forex markets provide currency diversification and potential for risk-adjusted returns, with governments using inflation to reduce debt burdens making multi-currency exposure essential. Asset classes group investments with similar characteristics and market behaviors, with diversification across uncorrelated classes reducing portfolio risk. Intermarket analysis reveals correlations between markets that can be exploited for trading advantages, while fixed income securities offer predictable income streams but face inflation and interest rate risks.

Chapter 2, the right currency investments can provide long-term appreciation as well as steady income yields. FACT 2: POTENTIAL FOR BETTER RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS There are more reasons to have forex exposure beyond currency diversification. Once you do some homework, you'll realize that forex is arguably among the most rewarding asset classes for traders and investors. Even though forex is dominated by short-term, high-risk speculators, there are investing/trading styles suitable for both: 1. More conservative active traders who use longer-term holding periods and specific methods and instruments to reduce risk. 2. Long-term investors who know how to: Ride stable, proven, long-term forex trends for capital gains. Earn steady income from “carry trades” or from investing in bonds, dividend stocks, and other income vehicles denominated in the right currencies.

Chapter 2 we discussed that, at the very least, we had to beat the 6 percent annual return from a 10-year U.S. government bond. That’s because buying those bonds would earn us 6 percent without having to take any risk. Since earning 10 percent is clearly more than earning 6 percent, ipso fatso, is it then true that paying $12 for a share that earns $1.20 a good deal? Well, life isn’t quite that simple (but as we’ll see in a later chapter, almost!). The bottom line is—we’re off to a great start, but we have to consider a few more things before we can make up our mind. First, $1.20 per share is what Jason’s Gum Shops earned last year. We have to determine whether we think the business will earn that $1.20 in the coming year—or more than that—or maybe less. Last year’s earnings may be a good starting point for estimating next year’s earnings, but it may not. If Jason’s Gum Shops doesn’t earn $1.20 next year, the business won’t be earning that 10 percent T H E L I T T L E B
