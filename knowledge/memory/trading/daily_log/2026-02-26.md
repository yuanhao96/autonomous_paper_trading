CHAPTER 1 Three Must-Know Forex Facts Forex's Top Three Lessons The three most important lessons you'll ever learn about foreign exchange (forex) markets are: 1. Everyone needs forex diversification. Just as every competent investor needs to diversify by asset classes and sectors, so too they need exposure to assets in multiple currencies and an understanding of forex trends and what's driving them. Yet most have almost all their assets denominated in one or two currencies. Today, that is an especially fatal error, because the governments behind most major currencies intend to get out of debt by causing inflation, which allows them to repay their bonds with depreciated money. That's good for those governments, and disastrous for those holding their weakened currency and anything denominated in it. They won't admit it, but historically low interest rates and a steady stream of economic stimulus programs betray their real intentions. They want to reduce their real debt, an

The documents cover asset class definitions, diversification principles, and intermarket analysis as tools for portfolio construction and trading. Key themes include the necessity of multi-currency exposure to hedge against government-induced inflation, the classification of investments into traditional and alternative asset classes, and the use of mathematical intermarket correlations to develop trading systems. Sources emphasize that forex markets provide early warning signals for other markets and that proper asset class diversification requires understanding correlation structures and risk factors unique to each category.

Forex markets provide currency diversification and potential for risk-adjusted returns, with governments using inflation to reduce debt burdens making multi-currency exposure essential. Asset classes group investments with similar characteristics and market behaviors, with diversification across uncorrelated classes reducing portfolio risk. Intermarket analysis reveals correlations between markets that can be exploited for trading advantages, while fixed income securities offer predictable income streams but face inflation and interest rate risks.

Chapter 2, the right currency investments can provide long-term appreciation as well as steady income yields. FACT 2: POTENTIAL FOR BETTER RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS There are more reasons to have forex exposure beyond currency diversification. Once you do some homework, you'll realize that forex is arguably among the most rewarding asset classes for traders and investors. Even though forex is dominated by short-term, high-risk speculators, there are investing/trading styles suitable for both: 1. More conservative active traders who use longer-term holding periods and specific methods and instruments to reduce risk. 2. Long-term investors who know how to: Ride stable, proven, long-term forex trends for capital gains. Earn steady income from “carry trades” or from investing in bonds, dividend stocks, and other income vehicles denominated in the right currencies.

Chapter 2 we discussed that, at the very least, we had to beat the 6 percent annual return from a 10-year U.S. government bond. That’s because buying those bonds would earn us 6 percent without having to take any risk. Since earning 10 percent is clearly more than earning 6 percent, ipso fatso, is it then true that paying $12 for a share that earns $1.20 a good deal? Well, life isn’t quite that simple (but as we’ll see in a later chapter, almost!). The bottom line is—we’re off to a great start, but we have to consider a few more things before we can make up our mind. First, $1.20 per share is what Jason’s Gum Shops earned last year. We have to determine whether we think the business will earn that $1.20 in the coming year—or more than that—or maybe less. Last year’s earnings may be a good starting point for estimating next year’s earnings, but it may not. If Jason’s Gum Shops doesn’t earn $1.20 next year, the business won’t be earning that 10 percent T H E L I T T L E B

So when it comes to figuring out whether a stock is worth buying, investors care most about where profits are headed, not where they&#x27;ve been. That&#x27;s why Wall Street&#x27;s preferred metric to value companies is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. It&#x27;s a tough break for its cousin, the trailing P/E. But the market has made up its collective mind. In this equation, the &quot;P&quot; stands for the company&#x27;s current stock price, and the &quot;E&quot; is the analysts&#x27;

These documents synthesize fundamental valuation metrics—primarily P/E ratios in trailing, forward, absolute, and relative forms—with technical analysis methodologies rooted in Dow Theory. The materials emphasize that trailing P/E uses historical 12-month earnings for objective valuation of mature companies, while forward P/E incorporates analyst estimates for growth assessment, with Wall Street generally preferring forward-looking metrics. Technical analysis complements fundamental valuation through trend identification, support/resistance levels, breakouts, and market sentiment indicators, acknowledging ongoing debates about market efficiency and behavioral factors.

ECNs are electronic systems that automatically match buy and sell orders, enabling direct trading without intermediaries and facilitating after-hours trading. They offer anonymity, faster execution, and extended trading hours but carry risks of thin liquidity, wide spreads, and access fees. Academic research shows mixed results on ECN cost advantages, with quoted spreads typically lower but effective spreads sometimes higher than market maker alternatives.

Forex market trading sessions 06 June 2025 What time does the forex market open? Beginners might ask. The answer is: it is always open 5 days a week, enabling traders and inventors to capitalize on opportunities 24 hours each day. However, understanding the Forex market is critical before it is possible to make profits, and Forex schedule and market sessions are crucial concepts in trading. In this guide, we will demystify market hours, explain session overlaps and their significance in trading, and provide explanations on how trading conditions are impacted by the global financial centers and their respective time zones. You, as an FX trader, need to know these details for success in this dynamic market. So, let’s begin. Start Trading in 10 Minutes Apply everything you’ve learnt on a real trading account with up to 1:2000 leverage, negative balance protection and outstanding support. Get Started Forex market hours explained The term Forex hours in FX means the continuous cycle of trading that happens across major financial hubs or centers. Unlike stock markets, which are known for their fixed opening and closing times, the FX market operates 24 hours a day, from Monday to Friday. It opens in one part of the world and closes in another part of the globe, which makes it a unique market. Since the FX market is primarily decentralized, this continuous cycle is possible and available for traders across the globe, no matter their time zone. When discussing the Forex market schedule, it is essential to consider the impact of global economic news events. For example, key economic announcements such as employment rates or central bank interest rate decisions happen during specific session hours, and it is crucial to monitor the economic calendar. Forex news events are crucial events that have a history of high volatility and can cause large price swings, which makes them very risky for beginners . This is why traders need to be aware of the major economic data, together wit

Forex markets offer early warning signals for other markets, with three major trading sessions (Tokyo, London, New York) providing varying liquidity and volatility.

Chapter 4. This means that currencies such as the EUR/USD and GBP/USD tend to trade within a very tight range during these hours. According to the Bank for International Settlements' Triennial Central Bank Survey of the FX market published in September 2004, the United Kingdom is the most active trading center, capturing 31 percent of total volume. Adding in Germany, France, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 42 percent of total FX trailing. The United States, on the other hand, is second only to the Untied Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only approximately 19 percent of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally important because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity to take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during late U.S. trading or in the overnight Asian session.
