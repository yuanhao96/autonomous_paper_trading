# Autonomous Evolving Investment System

A self-evolving US stock paper trading framework built on a dual-agent architecture. A **Trading Agent** ingests financial knowledge through a structured curriculum, builds and executes trading strategies, and evolves its own codebase over time. An **Auditor Agent** acts as an adversarial counterpart, inspecting strategies, backtests, and code changes for biases, data leakage, and self-deception. No real money is ever at risk -- all execution runs through Alpaca's paper trading API or a local mock broker.

                               Live Paper Trading
```

The Trading Agent proposes strategies and code changes. The Auditor Agent reviews every proposal through a battery of checks (look-ahead bias, overfitting, survivorship bias, data quality). Only artefacts that pass the audit gate are promoted to live paper trading.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- A Moonshot (Kimi) API key from platform.moonshot.cn (for LLM-driven knowledge synthesis)
- An Alpaca paper trading account (paper trading is the default; use --mock for local SQLite testing)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuanhao96/autonomous_paper_trading.git
cd autonomous_paper_trading
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
MOONSHOT_API_KEY=sk-...
ALPACA_API_KEY=...
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=...
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
```

### Running

```bash
# View current agent status (portfolio, curriculum stage, strategies)
python main.py --dry-run

# Run a daily trading cycle (Alpaca paper trading is the default)
python main.py

# Run with real Alpaca paper trading API
python main.py --mock   # use local SQLite instead of Alpaca

# Focus on specific tickers
python main.py --tickers AAPL,MSFT,GOOG
```

## V1 Features

- **Knowledge Curriculum** -- Four-stage structured learning progression (Foundations, Strategy Families, Risk Management, Advanced) with per-topic mastery tracked in markdown front-matter and assessed by LLM.
- **Paper Trading** -- Mock broker (local SQLite) or Alpaca paper trading API. Signals generated by registered strategies are risk-checked and executed automatically.
- **Starter Strategies** -- SMA Crossover (momentum) and RSI Mean Reversion ship out of the box.
- **Risk Management** -- Hard limits on position size, daily loss, and sector concentration derived from human-controlled preferences. The risk engine cannot be overridden by agents.
- **Walk-Forward Backtesting** -- Rolling train/test windows with equity curve tracking and performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate, P&L).
- **Auditor Agent** -- Checks for look-ahead bias, overfitting, survivorship bias, and data quality. Strategy promotion requires passing the audit gate.
- **Daily Reports** -- Markdown-formatted performance summaries suitable for messaging delivery (iMessage, Slack, Telegram).
- **LLM Integration** -- Centralized Moonshot (Kimi) API wrapper (OpenAI-compatible) with automatic retries, exponential backoff, and structured call logging.
- **Markdown Knowledge Memory** -- Structured markdown files with YAML front-matter for storing synthesized financial knowledge. BM25 full-text search via `rank_bm25`. Git-versionable and human-readable.
- **Investment Book Library** -- 120+ curated trading and investment books (converted from PDF to plain text) mapped to curriculum topics. Each nightly learning session supplements Wikipedia/arXiv content with relevant book excerpts.

## Learning Sources

Each nightly learning session draws from multiple source types per curriculum topic:

| Source | Used For | Details |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Investment Books** | All stages | Excerpts from 120+ books in `~/projects/investment-books-text/`, mapped per topic in `config/books.yaml` |
| **Wikipedia** | Stage 1–2 (Foundations, Strategy Families) | Concept summaries via Wikipedia REST API |
| **Web Search** | All stages | DuckDuckGo search snippets + full article extraction via `ddgs` package (free, no API key) |
| **arXiv (q-fin)** | Stage 3–4 (Risk Management, Advanced) | Academic paper abstracts from the quantitative finance category |
| **Alpaca News** | Ongoing daily tasks | Real-time market news for the watchlist tickers via Alpaca News API |

### Book Library Setup

Convert the PDF library to plain text (one-time setup):

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/bharaniabhishek123/some-investment-books.git ~/projects/some-investment-books
mkdir -p ~/projects/investment-books-text
find ~/projects/some-investment-books -name "*.pdf" | while IFS= read -r pdf; do
  pdftotext "$pdf" ~/projects/investment-books-text/"$(basename "$pdf" .pdf).txt" 2>/dev/null
done
```

The `config/books.yaml` file maps each curriculum `topic_id` to a list of relevant book filenames.
Override the books directory with the `BOOKS_DIR` environment variable.

## Roadmap

### V1 -- Foundation (current)

Knowledge ingestion and curriculum progression, simple paper trading with manually-approved strategies, daily performance reports, preferences YAML with human-only modification, and a basic auditor that checks backtest results for obvious biases.

### V2 -- Autonomous Strategy Development

The Trading Agent writes strategy code and indicators from its knowledge base. Walk-forward backtesting with agent-designed metrics. The Auditor reviews all code changes and backtest results. A promotion pipeline gates progression: backtest passes audit, paper-trades for N days, then auto-promotes.

### V3 -- Full Self-Evolution

The Trading Agent modifies its own framework (backtester, data pipelines, UI). A browser-based inspection dashboard is built by the agent. Architectural changes require auditor review plus human approval for major changes. The Auditor co-evolves, learning new audit techniques as the Trading Agent grows.

## Development

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Lint
ruff check . && mypy .
```
