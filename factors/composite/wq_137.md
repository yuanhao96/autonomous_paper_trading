# WQ-137: Three-factor product

## Formula
sign(delta(close, 1))
  * (-1 * correlation(high, volume, 10))
  * (1 + sma(high - low, 5) / close)

## Interpretation
Three-factor product:
1. Direction of today's price change (up/down)
2. Negative high-volume correlation -- bearish when highs are correlated with volume (climactic tops)
3. Volatility multiplier (1 + normalized average range)

The sign term sets direction, the correlation term determines conviction (contrarian on high-volume highs), and the volatility multiplier amplifies signals during volatile periods. This alpha effectively says: follow the trend when high-volume action is NOT pushing highs higher (i.e., volume is diverging from highs).
