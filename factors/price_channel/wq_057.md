## Formula
-1 * (close - sma(close, 30)) / decay_linear(close / delay(close, 1), 10)

## Interpretation
Deviation from 30-day SMA divided by linearly-weighted recent returns. Contrarian when price deviates from SMA with declining momentum -- reverts toward the mean when the deviation is large but momentum is fading.

## Parameters
| Param | Default | Range |
|-------|---------|-------|
| sma_window | 30 | [15, 60] |
| decay_window | 10 | [5, 20] |
