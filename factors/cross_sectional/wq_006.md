# WQ-006: Open-volume rank correlation

## Formula
-1 * correlation(rank(open), rank(volume), 10)

## Interpretation
Negative correlation between cross-sectional ranks of open price and volume. When stocks with relatively high opens also have relatively high volume, the factor is negative (bearish). Captures supply/demand imbalance at the open.
