# WQ-022: Change in high-volume correlation weighted by ranked volatility

-1 * delta(correlation(high, volume, 5), 5) * rank(stddev(close, 20))

## Interpretation
Measures the 5-day change in the rolling correlation between high price and volume, multiplied by the cross-sectional rank of 20-day volatility. Targets volatile stocks where the high-volume relationship is deteriorating.
