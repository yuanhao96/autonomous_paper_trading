# WQ-129: Proportion of total absolute movement that was downward, ...

## Formula
sum(where(delta(close, 1) < 0, abs(delta(close, 1)), 0), 12) / sum(abs(delta(close, 1)), 12) - 0.5

## Interpretation
Proportion of total absolute movement that was downward, over 12 days, centered at 0.5. Similar to RSI but centered -- negative means more up days (overbought), positive means more down days (oversold reversal signal).
