## Instructions
Based on the analysis findings, write actionable feedback for the planner:

2. What should the planner try differently in the next generation?
3. Suggest concrete changes (different indicators, adjusted parameters, different entry/exit logic).

Keep feedback concise (3-5 bullet points). Focus on what to DO, not just what's wrong.
Return plain text only.
