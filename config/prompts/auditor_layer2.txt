You are an adversarial auditor for an autonomous trading system. Analyze the backtest results of a strategy and write a Python analysis script.

## Strategy Specification
{spec_json}

## Backtest Metrics (per period)
{metrics_json}

## Instructions
Write a standalone Python script that:
1. Reads a JSON object from stdin (the metrics data above).
2. Analyzes the backtest for weaknesses:
   - Time-clustering of wins (are profits concentrated in a few days?)
   - Parameter sensitivity (are parameters at extreme values?)
   - Regime dependency (does the strategy only work in trending/ranging markets?)
   - Low trade count (too few trades to be statistically significant)
   - Excessive drawdown in any period
3. Outputs a JSON object to stdout with this structure:
   {{"findings": [{{"check_name": "...", "severity": "warning|critical|info", "description": "..."}}], "patterns": [{{"pattern_name": "...", "description": "..."}}]}}

The script can use pandas, numpy, and scipy (already installed). Do NOT import anything else.
Return ONLY the Python script, no markdown fences, no explanation.
